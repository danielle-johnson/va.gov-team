# How to change the url of a published resources and support article

When resources and support articles are published, the url is automatically created from the H1 with hyphens in between each word and special characters (periods, apostrophes) omitted. 

On rare occasions, the H1 will need to change once the page has been published and therefore the url will need to be updated too. 

Below are the steps for changing the URL for an R&S article.

1. Reach out to IA to determine if a redirect will need to be put in place. How long has the original article been live? Has it seen a lot of traffic? Is it linked to from other pages?
2. In the edit mode in Drupal, manually update the url to match the H1 with hyphens in between each word and all special characters omitted. Ex. [How to download and open a VA.gov PDF form](https://www.va.gov/resources/how-to-download-and-open-a-vagov-pdf-form/) would be /resources/how-to-download-and-open-a-vagov-pdf-form/. 
3. Publish the page. If a redirect needs to be put in place, publishing should coincide with the redirect work.
4. The sitemap should be automatically updated and will have removed the old URL, but reach out to Public Websites to confirm.
