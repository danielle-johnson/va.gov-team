# Appointment notifications service map workshop


## Goal

Learn how facilities help Veterans keep track of appointments.

## Research questions

-   How do facilities help Veterans keep track of their appointments?
-   What systems automatically communicate with Veterans about their appointments?
-   In what ways do any of these processes support or hurt the scheduling process?
-   How do these processes tie together the Veteran's medical appointment journey?
-   Where are facilities flexible in how they keep track of their appts? 
-   Are there regional similarities in how they communicate with Veterans?
-   How do facilities help providers manage and track Veteran appointments?

## Participants

We will run this workshop with VA facility staff who understand the scheduling process at 3-5 facilities. The facilities should be representative of regional differences:
* One urban
* One rural

TBD: We would like to speak to staff at facilities specifically involved in scheduling Community Care appointments. Refer to previous research.

Each workshop will include a group of 2-5 people actively involved in: 
* Scheduling veterans for appointments
* Managing schedulers/the scheduling process
* Educating veterans about scheduling

## Methodology

We will capture research in a service map format. [TODO: Link to template]

We will ask facility staff to describe the work they do when helping Veterans keep track of their appointments throughout the scheduling and appointment journey that we captured during the earlier research activities.

To do this we will capture key information from these sessions on a service blueprint, including touchpoints, actors, systems, pain points, and ideas they have for improving these processes.

We'll analyze this blueprint to understand the facility side of the overall medical scheduling service, and learn where VAOS can improve the process, either directly, or by working with other teams.

Depending on what we learn during the earlier research we may recommend doing this as a series of focus group sessions rather than 1:1s with each facility. The focus group format would allow facilities to build on each other's answers, which would work well for sharing knowledge and building out the service blueprint.
