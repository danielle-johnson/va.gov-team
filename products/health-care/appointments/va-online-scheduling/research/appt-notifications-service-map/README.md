# Appointment notifications discovery

## Goals

VA Online Scheduling (VAOS) helps Veterans schedule their appointments and keep track of those appointments via email and a list of appointments that shows up in the application.

During previous research we’ve heard that appointment reminders and notifications that come from VA facilities can be useful, but inconsistent in both content and cadence.

The notifications ecosystem is complex and involves systems outside of the VAOS team’s control. Our goals with this research are:

* Learn and document our shared understanding of all the systems and methods used to notify Veterans about their appointment journey, as well as the resources these require from facilities.
* Map the user journey for scheduling appointments and receiving care.
* From these learnings, we’ll recommend improvements to appointment scheduling notifications.

## Assumptions
* We believe that by enabling more targeted communications and notifications, we can help Veterans improve their awareness of pre- and post-appointment information change as it relates to the appointments they have scheduled.
* We believe Veterans will be more inclined to visit VAOS if we provide communications that are consistent and trustworthy.
* Facilities each help Veterans keep track of their appointments in different ways. They need some flexibility because of their location and the population that they serve, but there are some inefficiencies in these processes that don’t support Veterans. This research will help us better understand what's working and what's not for facilities, and recommend better practices.

## Method

We'll be running three different activities to capture this information:
* Secondary research to document existing research around notifications
* A service mapping workshop with facilities
* A TBD research effort with veterans to validate our findings.

These are described in detail below.

### Secondary research: document existing research around appointment notifications

* Document resources to inform future work on appointment messaging: [Appointment notifications secondary research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/research/appt-notifications-service-map/secondary-research/appt-notifications-secondary-research-resources.md).
* Document where different VA.gov projects that involve scheduling fit in the notification ecosystem: [Service maps - VA appt tools - internal audit](https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1606258692103/073961190cc646e036a4300e65524fa1b413182e?sender=ub08ff1d80ee7bd38d6c02354).
* Document the [channels veterans use to schedule appointments](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/research/appt-notifications-service-map/secondary-research/appt-scheduling-channels.md).

### Create a service map of the current notification experience

Map the overall service of notifications, focusing the systems and people who keep Veterans informed along that journey.

Research folder TBD

### Validate the notifications journey with veterans

Interview Veterans to validate their appointment notification needs.

Research folder TBD

## Research questions

How do Veterans keep track of their appointments?

What systems automatically communicate with Veterans about their appointments?

What tools do facilities use to help Veterans keep track of their appointments?

In what ways do any of the existing processes support the scheduling process, or make it difficult?


## Scope

### What we mean by appointment communications and notifications 

For the scope of this discovery effort a notification is anything that helps a Veteran keep track of their appointment, including:
* Email, text messages, phone calls, reminder cards, postcards, etc. manually sent by a human at VA, or delivered automatically during the process.
* Any list of appointments that a Veteran uses to keep track and plan their medical appointments, including VAOS, MHV, and their personal calendar.
* In-app alerts that relate specifically to changes in appointments (not general alerts about the state of the system)

### What we will not be doing

* We won’t be doing a content or UI audit of these communications.
* We will only look at the experience Veterans have with VA appointments, not community
