# Appointment notifications secondary research and resources

Existing research and other resources to help answer this question.

## VAOS research

### [VAOS vaccine research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/products/health-care/covid-vaccine-distro/scheduling/research/feb-2021-vaos-vaccine-concept-test/research-report.md#how-participants-manage-appointments)

"There was no clear pattern as to how participants receive reminders about their appointments from VA. Some reported that they receive multiple reminders ahead of their appointment. Others check My HealtheVet regularly to track their appointments. Some reported that they received reminders in the mail, with one telling us that they had previously received these reminder cards but hadn't gotten any recently. All but one reported that they rely heavily on their personal calendar as the primary source of truth for their appointments."

### [Appointments list usability test](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/research/jan-2021-appts-list-test/report-out.md#appointment-reminders-are-inconsistent)

"Most users reported some issue around the volume of notifications (including text, email, phone, and paper) they receive from the VA. Sometimes there are too many, sometimes none, and often it varies based on the provider.

"The content of the notifications they receive is generally helpful, though one user reported that sometimes the phone numbers are incorrect.

"Most users track their appointments across multiple systems: desk calendar, email, digital calendar, etc. Some create additional reminders for their appointments. Others rely on a calendar they review daily."
