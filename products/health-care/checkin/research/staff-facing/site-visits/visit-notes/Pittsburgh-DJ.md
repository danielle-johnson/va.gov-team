# Pittsburgh Site Visit Summary

## Key Takeaways
- University Drive campus has a dedicated central area for initial check in/pre-registration, but patients also have to check in for each appointment at the clinic location(s)
    - Patients often skip the pre-registration window and go directly to their appointment(s)
- Heinz campus does not have a dedicated central are for initial check in/pre-registration
    - Patients can check into multiple appointments at the kiosk, so they will still have to go to the desk at their appointment to state they are physically there and ready to be seen
- Much variation between clinics, but overall, after check-in, front office has to manually alert back office that the patient is ready. Usually occurs through paper, phone call, Teams chat rather than Vetlink, CPRS, Vista, VSE GUI systems
- Most front office team members have 4-9 windows up at a time
- Physical space design may determine the methods used for check in and patient tracking
- Cell reception is difficult in all areas
- Directives at National level, clinic specific, and scheduler specific
- Providers typically do not have access to same systems as front office, except for Vetlink. But even if they do have access, they don't use it frequently
- Understaffing in certain areas requires staff members to work multiple roles, such as supervisors managing check in/check out
- Will verify contact information each time but usually no questionnaires in check-in/check out process. 
- Check out only needed for scheduling next appointment, if needed

## Pre-registration
- Typical tools: VistA, ICB, Intranet (for directory), sometimes web-based VHIC system
- Environment: Set of windows with a chair per window. Not much of a waiting area, more of a hallway just a few scattered chairs
- Set of windows toward the front left side of the MC
- Greeter manages the flow of patients as they stand near windows. MSAs rotate through this role
    - Greeter will assign patients to an open window in order, unless MSA is on the phone or doesn't have a specific expertise to help patient
- Scans card to pull up patient in VistA and confirm demographics
- When scanner doesn't work, writes down patient info, lets the patient go to their appointment, and later will enter any information in the system
- When system goes down completely, will update manually even up to days later
- In the web based VHIC system, there is a numbering system (1,2) for patient status
- Many times Veterans will lose their ID or barcode rubbed off. Not usually new
- No patient tracking
- If patient just there for walkins, labs, no appointment, greeter will send them there.
- Even when line is long, they're not waiting more than 2 min
- Many times staff at the appointment's clinic will not have the ability to change information. Will send them back to Preregistration

## Imaging
- Typical tools
    - Check in: Qmatic Orchestra
    - Scheduling: CPRS, VSE GUI, VistA 
- Environment: Dedicated waiting areas for each modality, check in, and scheduling
- Can't physically see patients without order in the system
- GUI doesn't let them schedule a few months out
- Sometimes patients will take a ticket and sit down in waiting area. But this doesn't not mean they can be seen. Will have to be sent to scheduling if no appointment.
    - Can create a manual ticket through Qmatic, can move to scheduling queue
- Wait is about 4-5 min on a busy day. In some cases, 8-10 min if bombarded.
- Orders are printed. For certain stations, the only paper printed is kept in the back. For CT/MRI, a copy is also provided to patient
- Won't "no-show" until the end of the day
- CT will monitor cameras in the waiting room to check if patient is ready (sitting with their paperwork)
- MRI can't have cameras, so front office will call to say patient is being sent to them
- Nuc Med has a solo, dedicated MSA for scheduling, check in, and communication to back office
- If patient is late for imaging, usually do not need to reschedule, may just have to wait later
- Scheduling side has a list of orders on hold. Partially runs the list of holds per day, partially manual add information to the list. Doesn't say when it was put on hold.
    - Calls patient to get them scheduled/rescheduled or informs that can't be scheduled right now.
- Scheduling side will do investigative work to figure out what happened to an order
- Can also use Consult Tracker, when necessary

## Surgery
### Front office
- Typical tools: Vetlink, Vetext, VistA, CPRS, VSE GUI, Cisco (for supervisors monitoring staff)
- Environment: Check in/check out is the same window. Kiosks used to be across from windows
- If Vetlink goes down, then GUI is used
- GUI could check them in, but doesn't print out in the back. They need the printouts to notify back staff that patient is ready
- Supervisors often performing multiple duties, frequent callouts for front office staff
- Check in/check out done at the same desk
    - Check out simply for scheduling future appointments
    - Can't schedule next appoinments until the provider enters the RTC, may request patient to wait a few minutes in waiting area
    - No need to click or select anything else for check out on front office side
    - Provider/back office uses CPRS to check out patient, enter notes, and submit RTC 
- Vetext was supposed to be removed, but a few patients still use it so staff check just in case
- Prep is done at the end of every day or early morning. Print out sheet of who is coming and which clinics
- Break in the process occurs when paperwork is held somewhere by accident. Without the printout to the back office, they're unaware that a patient is ready
    - Patients may sit checked in and waiting for provider for a long time, even 2 hours
- Patient check in issue
    - Show up early and expect to be seen
    - Check in and leave the area
    - Overhead page or physically check for patient in common areas (bathrooms, etc)
    - Call their phone
- Why rely on print outs? 
    - The back office staff don't all have access to the computers, either physical computers or the software needed
    - Takes too long to pull up someone
    - May not know how to use the software
- Patient Tracking/Status - Patient asks, "Did they call for me yet?"
    - Staff check Vetlink first, then VistA, then VSE GUI to see what appointment he might have and with whom
    - Calls the staff for that area
- "Too late" for appoinment = 20 min
- Upon checkout, switches between GUI and VistA - RTC goes away from RM Grid
### Back office
- TYpical tools: Vetlink, VistA, sometimes VSE GUI
- Not actively monitoring any system, but will take quick peek at what's there or who is there in the system
- No status checking in system, relies on paper printout
- If there is an issue, will go into VistA to undo check-in and re-check-in for print out
- Concern - there is no way to show when the patient was pulled from system, no timestamp for printout
    - Was including memo in Vetlink with time to track, but not anymore
- Some clinics paperwork prints out differently or in the wrong spot, has to do prepwork in advance depending on clinic
- Have to create a profile in Vetlink and update if new clinics have been added or moved around so they can see an accurate patient queue
- In Vetlink, if patient is bold and has check mark, that means s/he checked in for your clinic
- No one can change patient's address or other information. Must email downstairs pre-registration to change patient's information
- The more screens you have, the harder it is to do your job
- Sometimes have to use Virtual Care Manager for Virtual Visits

## General Medicine
- Typical tools: Vetlink, CPRS, VCM, VSE GUI, Directory
- If Vetlink goes does, there is a screeching halt in the process
- Use Vetlink to check in, VSE GUI does not print
- There is also VistA but no one is trained on it
- Environment: Windows across from elevators to check in patients, waiting room on the side
- Check in at window, then triage for paperwork prep and determining where patients should go for vitals, then with provider
- After printed, place sheet in corresponding mailbox to notifiy back office that patient is checked in
- In Vetlink, it shows ticket number for patient, location, activity buttons
    - Can use the activity buttons to let others know status of patient, but no one looks closely enough
    - Would have to click "call", then "with nurse," then undo "with nurse" to allow someone else to track
- Used to use the loudspeaker, but for PHI reasons, no longer use it
- A lot of paperwork - go through a box of paper every 10-14 days
- Doctors are not using the system and continue to push back against it
    - Don't like change
    - Even if they were to see patients logged in the system, want to verify with paper anyway
- Previous "Spaghetti model" study done on this clinic for improvement in 2019, but nothing came of it
- Wishes to be able to do away with the triage area so they won't have to call the patient twice, just have them in one room to do vitals and provider
- Patients sometimes show up expecting to be seen in person, but they were scheduled for Virtual Visit
- Some providers have to come into the office and do in person + virtual all in one day
- With all the back and forth 12K-15K steps per day, checking in 200 people/day
- Space redesign would be necessary, otherwise concern all will stay the same
- After Visit Summary in VistA never came to fruition
- Doctors' tools:
    - Have CPRS
    - No access to VistA
    - Unless provider request Vetlink, can't use it. Not all service lines want them to use it, so no training either
- Have to troubleshoot issues themselves, response from onsite Vetlink staff is slow or not useful
- Training limited or nonexistent, figure it out on our own. No standardized process, everyone uses it differently
- Sometimes when patients are not checked in all the way, either kiosk or face-to-face glitch, there is no clear way to say that check in was incomplete

## Primary Care
- Tools: CPRS, Vetlink, VSE GUI, MS Teams
- Environment: Windows for check in, waiting area seating
- May have 10-12 people checking in at a time
- Each dr may have their own particular process and behavior
- Sometimes have to call nurses on the pickle phones

## Behavioral Health
- Tools: Vetlink, VSE GUI (multiple windows), MS Teams
    - Multiple windows of VSE GUI. At least one to see schedule, other to search & check in.
    - Vetlink is a "lifesaver" for front office and back office. No cell reception, pagers don't work well
    - Mandated that providers use Vetlink
    - 3-4 different options on how to let providers know patient is here, especially by Teams message
- Environment: Patients must walk into a room that contains a large waiting area and a desk for staff
- Prep work for next day - print lists for provider (if in person), email lists (if virtual)
- Hasn't seen partially checked in patients
- Busy clinic, doesn't have time to check and update everyone's information beyond identity verification
- Provider complaints that Vetlink times out after 40 minutes, but are sometimes unaware so the patient will be waiting 
- Minor questionnaire to make sure no suicidal thoughts. If check yes, they'll expedite
- Prefer that patients have a way to see and change their own information, but many bypass pre-registration and kiosk whn going to their appointments
- Check out if making another appointment. At that point, will ask if anything changed for their demographics
- One piece of data missing - how long were patients in the waiting room before provider brought them back to be seen?
    - Additional data points Would help troubleshoot where the workflow problem occurs
- Sometimes may need a urine sample for the substance abuse clinic. Use the memo field to document
- Same day access clinic is not provider specific, there is a rotating schedule assigned
- Should be a way to give patients an idea of how long they may be waiting, similar to the restaurant disks that buzz. To give patients freedom, especially since schedulers won't be able to give them time estimate
- Someone else oversees the Vetlink setup for staff, especially setting up new clinics and profile visibility
    - If not set up correctly, staff can see the whole service line and would have to weed through for their patients
- ICB needs to be incorporated into one system. May sometimes have to reach out to others to get updated
- Each provider added to a minimum of 3 clinics - in-person, phone, video clinics. Then additional based on their disciplines/teams
- RTC orders lingering in the systems because not scheduled when they leave
- Need the virtual waiting room for the virtual check out steps, warm handoff to make appointment
- If can't get in touch with patient, BH does 3 calls, then letter
- Concerns about how to manage virtual and physical waiting rooms at the same time

## Dental
- Tools: VistA, VSE GUI, SharePoint, CPRS, Vetext
    - Print out appoinment list the day before, highlight:
        - Green to check insurance
        - Pink for cancellation
    - Check off from list, then enter check in in VistA or VSE GUI
- Environment: Large waiting room with front desk, assistants also work in back with providers. Cgeck in for audiology and Dental. Audiology has no MSAs
- Pregistration and kiosk mostly skipped or kiosks don't work correctly
- No forms. If ineligible, staff will do as much investigation as they can first, then send patient to Admissions to fill out form, then return to clinic
- All get scheduled when they check out
- Use VistA, CPRS and GUI, but SharePoint is the best source for front desk and back office to keep up to date with appointments
    - Slots/Schedule is larger - shows more detail "more user friendly" 
    - Providers don't have scheduling keys for GUI (only assistants in front & back office do)
    - Can display meetings, patients, etc
    - Can't block schedule in VSE GUI
        - If emergency clinic added to schedule, would have to cancel clinic in order to schedule that time
    - GUI "is old"
- Emergency clinic will see 3-5 people per day between calls or walk in
- If system goes down
    - During check in - use the paper list of appointments, mark with different color and enter when system is back up
    - During check out - use routing slip - "Can we call you when system is back up"
- Can see through VistA if patient has checked in. They may check in to multiple appointments and not really be there in the waiting room.
- Staff will still have to check the waiting room for patients
- MSA worked in Primary Care previously - different set up everywhere
- Not allowed to change any demographics information, mandate taken away. Patient would have to go to Admissions.
- Concern - How can ineligibility be caught upon making the appointment, prior to check in?
- Usually scheduled immediately, so no RTCs in the system, except for all the cancellations during covid. A lot of RTCs had to be cleaned up
- Dr determines what is "too late" to see appointment
- Consult Tracking Manager used, when necessary

## Primary Care
- Tools: Vetlink, VSE GUI, CPRS, VistA, ICB, Vetext, Consult Tracker, Teams
    - 7-9 windows up at a time
    - Will forget something with "50 different screens up"
- Environment: 3 pods for check in, different disciplines at each pod
- Prep - pull insurance capture report in the morning
- Groups set up in teams to alert back office who is ready to be seen
- Sometimes provider will just come out to get them (especially BH) without being notified. Skips check in.
- On VSE it doesn't show check in if MSAs didn't check them in
- After Visit Summary from CPRS doesn't always print out automatically
- Can't schedule past 6 weeks in VSE GUI
- "Open access was to improve access, but didn't. People would no show, frequent RTCs bog down schedule. RTCs hard to keep up with. Time consuming."
- Performing multiple tasks at the front desk, including RTC clean up, patients get upset.
- If you disposition but don't assign, it will go back to provider. Unexpected, have to be diligent about it
- If walk in, will need to refresh ICB after scheduling. MSAs get dinged for not doing ICB update, even if not their service line. Whomever checked in will get dinged
- Sometimes patients will get the wrong pod - either from prereg or from kiosk
- Patients will just sit down, not check with the pod
- If providers check the chart before appointment, to get background on their patient, it can sometimes check out the patient before checking them in
- Many patients just walk out the door, with no check out
- 2 attempts - 1 call, 1 letter
- Allowed to change demographics through GUI
- MSAs in front and then surgical, behavioral health MSAS in back
- Space redesign needed for proper check in and wayfinding, especially for surgical and behavioral health MSAs. Patients can't always hear in this location
- Should have kiosks upstairs, near the front desk so they can be sure to do correctly and be in the location
- Don't want them checking in for all appointments
- Accurate check in helps staff time breaks
- Systems need to communicate with each other
- Pop up on Vetlink asks if staff checked insurance
- If for some reason, staff forgets to alert the back for patient, Patient will sit there for hours
- Sometimes early check in and long lines
- Had Vetext setup to alert via email, but no longer works
- Providers do not use Vetlink
- Hard to provide patients with estimated wait time. LPNs are the only ones who know providers are running behind

## Rehab
- Tools: VSE GUI, CPRS, VistA, Virtual Care Manager, Teams
- Environment: Shared waiting room
- Daily prep: Print out and divide into clinic specific folders
- Will check on list that they're in, then later enter into system
- Most patients are good about filling out kiosk, then stop at the desk to check if they're checked in. Don't usually bypass check in
- Providers will usually come out on time, but if not staff will inform via Teams
- Check out for next appointment, no demographics or insurance
- Interchangeable MSAs
- Not many using Vetext
- Process is smoother here, mostly just let the doctors know patients are here
- Usually have escorts if there are any issues with vision, hearing
- Late is not an issue, usually take everyone
- Gym in the back, so no separate rooms for each provider
- VSE GUI issues
    - Needs to do what they want instead of just following VistA's capabilities
    - Doesn't delete
    - Runs poorly
    - PT has multiple appointments, doesn't let you clean up afterward
    - Doesn't let you put in lab, have to use VistA anyway

## Vetlink Coordinator
- VistA has to have the new clinics in there before can be added to Vetlink
- Kiosk groups for each area, have to load clinic to a specific group
- Give staff access to that clinic group
- Workflows created depending what they want to do. Workflow for each or combined with Pre-reg
- Can make sure that cover sheets to automatically print out with a specific template
- Can load questionnaires such as flu shot, ebola, covid, but typically no other documentation/questionnaires
- Terrible cell coverage if you don't have Verizon. Caused problems with Vetext, patients were not receiving text messages
- Biggest concern - Vetlink doesn't talk to other programs, like MyHealtheVet.
    - They think info auto loads to Myhealthevet, but it only talks to VistA
    - Concern that it's not internet based, thinks it would be faster
    - Bulky equipment, hard to calibrate, frequent repairs
- Usage measurement for success 75% pre-covid

## Pharmacy
- Tools: Qmatic, Script Pro, Audiocare (new for them)
- Environment: Take ticket from simple kiosk, wait until number is called in waiting area, talk to pharmacist at the window, then sit down in waiting room to wait for prescription fill needed
- Patients usually have other appointments aside from their Pharmacy stop
    - Would be beneficial to be able to queue them up from their other appointment to make sure their prescription could be ready
- Scan Patients' VHIC to bring up profile
- Staff side process seems to be double-queuing 
- Patients prefer the face-to-face personal touch
- 200-350 patients/day, divided between 4 people
- Can resolve issues on the spot, but if not there is another set of pharmacists behind them to help
- Patients are not tied to appointments
- Still like face to face, but if there was a way to integrate parts with technology - check in for appointment, kiosk demographics, refill scipts, MyHealtheVet

## Lab
- Tools: VistA, calculator
- Environment: Small, shared room across from small waiting room
- Take ticket from "deli counter" manual ticket dispenser, then staff physically clicks the next number on the remote and calls out number
- If they skip a patient because patient steps away from waiting area, the patient will have to take another number
- Scan VA card to pull them up in VistA
- Ask patient to type in their full social security number in the calculator
- Many patients will come in saying they got a letter to go to lab, but there are no orders. Ask them to check and come back, will have to do this process frequently.
- Technical issues often - old computers. Have to ask if someone with a working computer can help
- Prefers the numbering system at Heinz - with automated calling instead of staff physically calling numbers
