# Research Plan for Pre-check-in Discovery
August 2021

## Goals
### What product & team are you doing this research for?
VSA Healthcare Experience: Check-in

### Background
This product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check-in for a medical appointment. To help streamline the day of check-in experience, the healthcare experience team is exploring the concept of pre-check-in, which would allow Veterans to complete a series of tasks prior to their appointment from the comfort of their homes. These tasks could include:
- reviewing contact information
- reviewing insurance
- answering questionnaires

### Research questions:
- Do Veterans find value in being able to complete any tasks a few days prior to their appointment?
- What specific tasks do Veterans find value in reviewing and updating?
- How do Veterans want to be notified that they have these tasks to complete?

### Hypotheses:
- Veterans will verbalize how completing these tasks before an appointment is helpful to them, such as it will shortened their day of check-in experience or allow them to review the information on their own time and not rush.
- Veterans will have clear opinions on what tasks bring value to the pre-check-in experience.
- Based upon findings from previous research, Veterans will want to be notified via text or email.

## Method
Remote, moderated sessions with interview questions, review of a UXPin prototype, and an Optimal Sort card sort conducted on Zoom.

The prototype will help give context to the Veteran as to what we mean by a pre-check-in experience. It is to be utilized more for feedback on the validity of this concept than usability testing. However, we should receive some usability feedback in the process.

The card sort will help us prioritize tasks that Veterans truly find valuable for implementation.

## Participants and Recruitment
### Primary criteria / Must have:
- 15 participants (for a minimum of 8 completed sessions)
- Participants must use VA health care AND had an in-person medical appointment at a VA facility within the last six months (disqualify those that don't)
- Participants must not exclusively go to community care providers for their appointments; some appointments must be at an actual VA facility.
- Participants must be willing to join the research session via their laptop/desktop computers (no mobile phones due to prototype).

- Please screen participants based on these questions:
  - Does the following statement describe you? I currently use VA health care AND had an in-person medical appointment at a VA facility within the last six months.
    - Yes (Qualify)
    - No (Disqualify)
  - How many of your medical appointments are with community care providers and not providers at VA facilities?
    - All (Disqualify)
    - Most (Qualify)
    - Some (Qualify)
    - None (Qualify)

Please confirm participants have Zoom downloaded prior to the session and they know how to screen share.
Due to the use of a UXPin prototype, for this session:
- we are unable to include those who use assistive technology, such as screen readers (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and ChromeVox).
- we are unable to include people with significant vision loss.
- we are unable to include people who use magnification tools.

### Secondary criteria / Would like to have
- At least 1 woman
- At least 1 person of color
- At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55
- At least one person that does not have a college degree (to include enlisted Vets)
- At least one person that has no college experience
- At least one person who lives in a rural or remote area
- At least one person who lives in a major metropolitan area
- At least one participant that has identified cognitive impairments and/or functional disabilities.
  - Examples of diagnoses that may align with this would be Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), autism, and vertigo. Other conditions may be aphasia, dyslexia, dyscalculia, distractibility, memory loss, reading difficulties, low tolerance for cognitive overload, and intellectual/adaptive functioning challenges such as learning and problem-solving.
- At least one non-native English speaker
