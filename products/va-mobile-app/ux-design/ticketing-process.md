# Ticketing for UI/UX Refinements

#### Background
We are making small UX/UI refinements to the app to improve design. We are spinning up tickets from two Mural boards ([this roadmap prioritization board](https://app.mural.co/invitation/mural/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1624550011273?sender=bridget7669&key=bc4aa47a-e82e-43ab-b15a-5662fdbd70aa) & [this board](https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1624293348080/4aab1766fa23b86b35a4dde2eb37601967af9b08?sender=bridget7669) capturing feedback & ideas). Our goals with these refinements are to give the app a more polished feel.

#### Process
1. Pick up a ticket tagged as "UX" from the "App Polish" epic or create a new ticket. 
3. Estimate it, assign it to yourself, and let folks know you are working on it.
4. After completing the work, create a shell ticket for frontend implementation. Use the tag "frontend" and put it in the "App Polish" epic. Send Ashley a Slack to let her know this ticket is ready for pick up.
5. If applicable, update the Sketch design library with any updates to common components. Communicate common components updates to the rest of the design team.
