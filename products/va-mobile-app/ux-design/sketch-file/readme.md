## Sketch file of design library
- Uploaded to GitHub on 6/30/21 and it's now accessible to all designers via Sketch Cloud as of 7/15/21!  

## Guidance for making updates to Sketch library
Every designer on the team can make updates to the Design library file. Bridget, Meli, and Melissa discussed an initial process for this and we came up with the following guidelines for us:  
- Go to the **Mobile App Design Library - 6.21.21** file in the "VA Mobile App Design Library" folder on Sketch Cloud
- Hit "edit"
- You should be able to see other designer's cursors in the file! And in the upper right you'll see a list of collaborators. 
- Add in new symbols or make updates to existing symbols. 
    - When you make updates that are new symbol additions, please create the symbols on the **Symbols** page, and also place the symbols on the **Styles**  pages in whatever place seems best to you.
    - When creating new symbols, use a naming convention that makes sense to you. Before creating a new category, see if the new symbols fit under an existing one, like Buttons or Global Components.
- Hit "save" for the changes to be reflected in the cloud (you'll see changes other editors are making in their files in real-time but anyone's changes won't sync to the cloud until they save).
- Create a change log comment noting the update you made.  
   
**Note: Be purposeful when updating the Library file -- the updates you make will be pushed to all designers using the library.**

# Future goals
Some of our future design goals include: 

- Increase the polish of MVP common components. 
    - **Why:** To improve the app's visual design 
- Revisit where we are using native components and where we are not, and look for opportunities to increase the native mobile UX of the app while maintaining accessibility
    - **Why:** To offer a more native mobile feeling experience that utilizes platform patterns users are already familiar with
- Make refinements & new additions at the component-level; improve documentation of components 
    - **Why:** So that building out future features & implementing refinements for existing ones is more efficient
