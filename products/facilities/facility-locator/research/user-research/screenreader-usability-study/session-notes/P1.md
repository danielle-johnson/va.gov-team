Discovery
---------

### Internet searching for a location

During our time together, we'll mostly be focused on finding VA locations online.

Can you tell me of a recent time when you used the internet to find the location of a place that you needed to visit?  

-   Like for maps or something. I normally just google it. 

Last time: 

-   probably last week. 

Which device: 

-   I am always on my laptop. If I am on my phone and find where I want to get there I just put it in the map. I don't do the whole look up the address. Before you print out directs but with GPS you put it in the phone then it takes you there. Google maps or just maps, whatever. 

On computer: 

-   the issue on the computer is that if you pull up a map it isnt accessible with street views. 

Last week: 

-   you get it in a lot of places, it brings up a picture and they aren't accessible, they don't make sense to a screen reader. It may give coordinates but theres no way. I suppose when someone sees a dot they can know where they are going but it doesn't help with a screen reader. Graphical maps are not practical. Sometimes you can call but I sue to use maps press. It would first give you the map but then get turn my turn. I haven't used it in a  long time. 

Could you tell me about the last time you searched for a VA location? 

-   Well yes, john Cochran va. I just use my phone and they normally need the directions when they take me. I can tell them where it is but cant tell them when to turn. 

Have you ever used the VA.gov website? 

-   Sure yea.

If yes, can you tell me briefly about the last time you used VA.gov? 

-   it depends on the part I guess. It is confusing to me these guys. I use shortcuts. I use my HealtheVet, that's probably the one I go to the most. I have looked up other things to. I use it about 5-6 times a year to find something. 

What could have been better? 

-   The last time I used it was the login process was confusing for credentials and how to login. I would pick myHealtheVet but it didn't always take me where I wanted to go, it would take me there but I would need to click other links to get back where I was. Maybe we have a few extra steps. It is different depending on how you get there. I guess if you start va.gov it will be the same page but if you start where I do. I generally have a favorites to go to the page I want and sometimes something changes and the page drops you in a different place. 

TASKS
-----

### Task 1

### Va: I would go to google and type it in. 

#### Getting to 'Find a VA location'

Next, I'm going to ask you to complete a task.

Could you please find your nearest VA? 

1.  I would probably just type into Google VA washington, mo. First, I minimize the screen to get to Edge. My edge defaults to Google. And I'm just usually right there where I can just type it in. That's what I honestly do probably 70 percent of the time.

Why minimize screen: [User sizes browser window to take up 1 quarter of is desktop" 

1.  "minimizing the screen, getting back to the desktop is like home base. I like to have a clean start to be able to have everything minimized so there's no other windows to confuse the screen reader. I keep my desktop clean, it has maybe 20 icons on it and those are apps. So if I want to go to mail I just click O for outlook or E for edge and I am in. 

[back to search] 

1.  I am in Google, I did the search. Google, they're aren't as good as it use to be, now they clutter it all up. They usually lay everything out by heading. So, I'll just hit the letter H for heading, which by the way is one of the fastest ways that blind people use JAWS on a webpage, cuz it gets you around all the extraneous junk. Reading from top to bottom with a screenreader is very tedious. I have department of va so arrow down to see if it is what I want and there it is.\
    [18:18]

The address: 

1.  Yes. 

What at this point: 

1.  from here they don't have their own webpage so there's nothing for me...but it pulled the address off of the VA website. [has SR repeat the source "Department of Veteran Affairs"] See, I wouldn't really go there now because I already found what I wanted. But this is also one that I happen to know because it's 8/10's of a mile. 

### Task 2

#### Using 'Find a VA location' near current location

[SEARCH]

Next, I'm going to walk us through a scenario. I'd like you to imagine that you've just moved to where you live today and you're looking for a dermatologist at your nearest VA. You can pretend that you don't know where that is. Go to the VA website to do that.

[ADVANCED USER GETS LOST EASILY]

How might you do that on this page? 

1.  You want me to go to va.gov? 

[M: yeah][user types in VA.gov in address bar] 

1.  [20:45] I don't know if you heard that but usually at the top of the page there is a skip the content link which skips over the navigation. Very unreliable with JAWS, because depending on how the page is laid out, it may do nothing for you. In this case it did work because it took me down to the first level one heading.  It took me to 'Service member benefits'.

[moderator stops him, he tries to replicate] "Well it took me to Veterans portrait" [user advances to next item, heading level 2]  Basically, it took me to 'Service member benefits'.

1.  I would usually still use H. that is how you get the main areas on the website and go from there. [Clicks on service member benefits and tries to make sense of the task within this new context] [2nd click. User goes to smb page and has screen reader announce all elements on the page, we hear regions and headings and links as user is trying to understand what this page is about] 

[Talk me through where you are on VA.gov now:] 

1.  Well, I first went to va.gov and the first heading that came up is service member benefits. Which, erm, I don't know. See, it's service member benefits. I am not really a service member. 

[user goes back to home page to retrace his steps and has JAWS read SMB and the verbiage below it again. keeps navigating by headings 

1.  [SR: heading level 2 links, 'Service member benefit' ]See you got 'family member'

2.  Not once did I hear veteran benefits so I really need to go to service member benefits then there was veteran benefits. 

Where you'd find the location, a dermatologist, on this page: 

[24:24]

1.  I have no idea because that is a subset. First you'd need to go some health benefit thing. And health benefits are different from active to veteran. It says "Access and manage your VA benefits and health care" but that's just a heading. I don't really know how I got here because I did not change the page but I did not hear this before. It's almost like I got switched to my HealtheVet.

Address bar: 

1.  I can get there if that's what you want. The one thing I said is that I typed in va.gov and this is not the page it took me to. I went back a page and now this page with my screen reader. I have been to this page before; I did not hear this before. This is one of the confusing things, it really depends on how the page is laid out.  See I guess that's what it was, I did skip content but why would it take me to the middle of the page.\
    [26:49]

2.  Page order, links list:  Yeah but here again you asked me how I would do it. I really dislike the lists link; it doesn't always put everything in the list. So I don't find it the greatest, that's the last thing I would do. See, this particular way, right here, to me, maybe I don't do it because it's like a 'blind only' thing and I rather navigate the page like everybody else does. There is nothing when I click F, it is not on this list and that's the downsize and why I don't like it. 

3.  [30:16] Menu button: Right there, I would do that to eventually because the menu is a great thing however it is very new that the screen reader will actually use it but on a lot of websites that link will drive you crazy. Right there. 

4.  Tell me about the menu: first off I wasn't sure it was reading the menu because the screen will change and it is helpful if I arrow back up.  It would be helpful if I click menu and it would drop down so I know where the menu started. Right now I assume we are in the menu but it doesn't say that. That links thing still doesn't work here. 

5.  What would you have it do: I would normally never skip content because usually I expected it to not work but in this case it worked. I would normally arrow down if on a new page I don't know because I have no clue. I wouldn't jump over so I would arrow down to menu and click spacebar. Most people use it like this but this is like a word press engine that we are running on or something like it. The menu button at the top is normally now but I wish it would say window open or help text with place markers, like down arrow and press button. [Moderator helps user] If you didn't say it I wouldn't have known it was open. When it says something but nothing happened you can't tell if anything happened. I don't even know what that is. Close button collapsed.  

6.  How would you find it on this page: 

-   The search button, does it actually work? Could I put in dermatologist?

1.  Uses search button. Uses term "derm" it brought up a lot of documents under there. That is something I would try once but I can see that didn't work so I would just go back but I don't know if that would work. 

On Facility Locator

1.  The find locations is helpful because it tells me which page I am on and what it is for. Sometimes you don't even know what the page is for. 

2.  Can I ask you a question. You asked me to find a dermatologist but can I do that on this page? I'm confused. You took me to find a location but you are actually asking me to find something specific. It's confusing because it is about finding a VA location; 

3.  I'm not going to find a dermatologist here [laughs] I know this. Maybe I wouldn't if I just moved here I wouldn't know. 

4.  That is still the case, I haven't found, I don't know if use my locations will help me. 

5.  Referring to: Never mind I am going to press that so it will know where I am. Uses VA health, services: dermatology. 

Talk me through what you did and heard: 

1.  These are drop down boxes because jaws will say something like combo box which is a select list and I went form list to list. See the combo box there. I can slow it down if I need to. I went to facility type which is good and service type is good. Then knowing what I know the result is crazy because it would send me to, maybe based on location, I am closer to st louis than I am st James. It is in the wrong directions but again my computer. 

[pauses on location input label that precedes the input field]

1.  See that there, I don't know if that's a place where I can type because it does not say edit. Now it did when I pressed enter. [input is now in focus] But I didn't know that. If it was an edit box or a form field.  It should just say the word 'edit'.  If it's a place that you can type, it should say edit. 

[Mod points out Zip code, as a label:

1.  See, I think that label is more of a place marker in the field, so when I pressed enter into it is when I got to the place where you can type. You're seeing it one way but JAWS is reading it in a different way. JAWS works best on form fields that use a label tag, like 'label: city, state and then the form field would be right under'.  The way we do websites is when there's a link it says link but now it is done through code and the fields aren't how they use to be. If it were my website it would be HTML with last name and then the field. Now you need to click enter on everything because you don't really know. It's confusing to users new to computers and screen readers."

2.  Better for the form field be the place marker: see what I mean theres nothing that tells me to enter infomration. You say it is a label and there's no edit until I click enter there. Because it just says use location then skips over to facility. The edit wasn't there the first time I went through here. The webpages, it is confusing to people. It's not for me because I do it a lot, it will be confusing for people that are new at it they will be scared. I am not but others wont click enter. 

3.  Button at this moment, what's that:  the way I have jaws is that I need to press enter to get into the field. Pressing enter did nothing because I have to get out of the field. See theres no way to activate that. JAWS takes the page and puts it into the buffer that is readable form top to bottom, it doesn't matter if it is actually put that way. It is in a virtual window. Theres no submit button now. At least I am not hearing one. It would submit based on that location, okay that's fine I didn't understand that. I thought I had to pick a location first. 

-   Can you try that now?

-   How does this search experience work for you?

-   What could be improved?

[RESULTS]

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/TDDK448Bn2JNeX8EBxlCT-dVqPkBuBuWzHttlD6yM70bcLPbndbokPzH9RP62L_E_W_Q9T8LD7bN_FJrktScwit3kQbJm9EIC2AUqgM1ESDFNsJnux-8QYHbNmu_79BlpV68IVW2)

1.  Can you talk me through the location options? If there are more results there I am not hearing them.  

2.  Mentioned you might not use the map but what about on this page: I am not sure what it said, it is all jammed together. Someone left out spaces. That's funny that's my girlfriends last name. I guess it was a maps button so I was right. 

3.  How was it for you: It was not clear. It is usually that was an image and the text to it wasn't written well. I am used to the map button saying that I guess. I don't know what it said, do you know what it is supposed to say. 

4.  Sighted users would see get directions: really. 

5.  Did it just not read it correctly: its just not reading it correct. The alt text isnt what to deal with the screen. 

6.  Thoughts: that left the site and went to google maps. Do you want me to go there or just stay here. 

7.  How could it have been more obvious to you:  if it says get directions button or link. Then I would know. There again I will try but many people won't. I am sue to the computer doing what I expect it to do. 

8.  New tab expected or desired preference: open a new tab is the best thing because I can just close it like I did control W. then when you close it Jaws moves you back to where you were. Sometimes it will restart but jaws will take you exactly where you were, it keeps its place. 

9.  Not open a new one: it is normally always helpful. I don't like to have a lot of tabs but if going to a different sight I don't mind because then I know I am not on va.gov anymore. 

10. Did read option to explore map, did you hear that at all: jaws normally puts it at the bottom of the page. Want me to see if I can find it. I know it will be down. If you have a map there its not telling me. There are different ways to use jaws. I have graphics turned off unless there is a label there. There's a way I can tell jaws what I want to see. I would put it on longest. I just don't think JAWS cant see the graphic. See where it has simple layout, I can change it out to how it really is laid out. It could read the same or totally different. It is the same, JAWS sees it both the same. It is interesting it says the quote there. See there it read the get directions correctly because it wasn't in a virtual buffer. Then when I go back up it didn't say link. Where is the map when looking at the screen. 

11. Two columns, the map is right next to the list: typically going back. The default on JAWS is the simple layout and only an advance user like me knows how to change it so I don't know why it read that get directions right on this one but not the other. You have to remember JAWS isnt perfect. Sometimes I don't know which to blame, page or screen reader. None of them are perfect. 

-   How does this listing work for you?

-   What could be improved?

### Task 3

#### Using 'Find a VA location' to plan ahead

Next, I'm going to walk us through a different scenario. Imagine you are planning a trip and you'd like to know what the closest VA hospital would be from where you'll be staying. It can be somewhere you've visited in the past if that's easier.

1.  How might you do that on this page? I just cheated right there. JAWS has quick navigation; h headings  is edit. If I know it's on the page I can just click c for combo. That's how I got here so quick that's just an FYI. I cleared it by clicked edit then select all and backspace. 

2.  Maybe a place you went in the past few years you know a little about: Memphis, 

3.  Reverted back to your location in MO: lets click submit first before we jump to that conclusion. Yupp it did that and I don't know why it did that. All I did was press tab. 

4.  Lets try that again: That time I didn't need to highlight it all I needed to do was backspace. It doesn't like it. why does it say 1.5 miles. that's why I thought it didn't change because that's what I heard. 

5.  There are many locations and A is your first one: Why does it say A1.5 miles though. 

6.  It is the distance: oh it thinks I am in Memphis, never mind that was just me. 

7.  It thinks its only 1.5 miles away: I think when it asked my location it, it wasn't really asking where I wanted to go. 

8.  Results: now that I know what it is supposed to say, get directions, it is clear and I am not having issues with the list. 

9.  Mileage, how could it be best described.: I think what it is doing honestly. It thinks I am in the middle of Memphis so I think it thinks I am in the heart of the city. It is like a GPS thing since I didn't provide an address. If I would provide a street the miles would change but I think it is that far away form the heart of the city. I knew there were VA centers down there. The ABC thing isnt an issue. Letters or number isn't an issue. The only way to make it clearer is just a dot. It was the miles that was confusing. 

10. Dot after the a: no like an unordered list. That is minor and I knew it was a list. If it were 2 things and the B would have made that perfectly clear. It was the miles throwing me off.

11. How could the miles be more obvious: maybe just more text like, 1.5 miles away or to location. A little bit more descriptive. Other than that it wasn't bad.

12. Location you are in now. Read one more time:  is that what you meant. The alert box read fine. 

13. What does it say for you: I think it was about hours. Yeah, that is perfect actually. 

14. Clear: Yupp. It is probably a good thing it had the alert because you might just skip over it. we just ignore what we don't want to hear. 

15. Any infomration you would have liked that isnt there: I think that is everything you really need. The only thing it doesn't have is hours but that is standard. I wouldn't even add it because less is more with screen readers. The more you put in there the more we need to listen to on each location. 

16. Anything else that would be helpful on this page: No everything on the page is laid out really well. Another thing, I will go to the top for a second. One reason I like that is that it says menu collapse so I know I can open it up. Then I guess that is the bottom of the list. 

17. It read what was above the list first: that's what I mean it can be hard to tell but I like that. My website is like that, if you have navigation on the top of the page, you like to have skip to content not to read the navigation part. You can get to the meat of information but if needed I can pull up menu. It is a new trend I actually like because it declutters the screen. If you see it jaws will read it so I jump by headings and sometimes I need to go back to the menu and remind myself to do that. That's why I did it, I am sue the navigation at the top. Most websites are still this way. You change to a different page and the first 20 lines are actually the same. It is maybe on the side, nice for visually purposed but not for the screen reader. It is something we need to get use to doing. 

18. Broad, not just va: no not just va. It is how everything use to be, we didn't have all of the interactive things it was more laid out static like instead of dynamic. You had to invent the drop downs your own. This is much cleaner and easier. Just maybe have something say menu start or end. It isnt bad because there is a close and a lot of them don't even have that. Walmart is where I do my online shopping and it ahs that menu but no close. The only way tog et out of it is to esc. 

19. Better or worse: I think having something that says close menu is better especially for those that aren't as verse on the computer. I get myself in trouble by pressing buttons to fast times. But it is better to have the close menu so you know you're at the end. Sometimes you can't tell when you've left the menu and just reading the screen.

20. Other apps that work well for you: I will say what really changed for me personal for the screen reader. Over the last year we have edge and it is running accessibility on it, I use to run internet explorer. Google chrome. I had multiple because depending on the page I am on; some would let me read the list but have to switch browsers. The web was frustrating 2 years ago but edge is the only one I need to use. 

21. How better: I don't know exactly. Why because each page reacts how I expect it to. If theres a button and I press it, it does what I expect whereas other browsers wont. The item would not work. It wasn't the old edge; it was only since it was updated. I loathe when they do update it because I'm afraid they will break it. another reason is because develops are becoming more aware of the usability. It is really  just the browser that has change for me. 

Post-Task Interview
-------------------

1.  If you had a magic wand and could fix one thing about the features you interacted with today, what would it be? I think get the one label for get directions to be fixed. Most people wouldn't know what that is and not use it. the first part was self-inflicted because I was just trying it out. The menu button is well labeled. It worked like I expected. I could press esc but the close button works. 

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

-   Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know? I know we worked on this one page but will this go to the other pages because the va has some crowded pages if you know what I mean. 

-   One that comes to mind: I don't know because I haven't looked lately. I guess over the last year or two it ahs gotten better. There was a lot of repeated information it will read it 2-3 times. Like newspapers I read online, they give you the same 5 top stories 3-5 times on one page. It may not visually look like that but that's how the screen reader reads it. what every you see is what I would like jaws to read besides alt tags so we know what it is. 

-   From the participant: The extra things you do to make it accessible is it a lot of work or a little work. 

Thank-You and Closing
