Discovery
---------

### Internet searching for a location

During our time together, we'll mostly be focused on finding VA locations online.

Can you tell me of a recent time when you used the internet to find the location of a place that you needed to visit? 

-   It was Wednesday. I had a VA hearing in Little Rock that I'd never heard of, my wife never heard of so we looked it up online and got directions. Almost made it there. The VES, the Veteran's Exam Service, gave us a convoluted set of addresses so we looked it up on the web and got a better set of directions. We thought we were all set, we were really close and we stopped to ask directions but then they sent us the wrong way. By the time we found out where we were, we were late but the doctor was nice. He allowed us to wait and they had a no show so they fit us in later. 

How found online: 

-   She has a map program that she likes to look at, she's not super computer literate but gets along pretty good. I like to go into some that have written directions to get to places to figure out which one works the best. Which one we can get printed off or write down. 

Which do you like that offers written directions?

-   I can't see but she's just starting to use maps on her iPhone so that'll be a big plus when we can start using that on a regular basis. 

Did you say there was one that you like to use?

-   I couldn't really tell ya. I just use whatever the search engine, tell it from here to there, it comes up with whichever, whether it's MapQuest, Google, or any of the others. I don't know which it brings up all the time that gives me step by step directions, turn by turn directions. That way, I can help her keep track of where we are if she just has a printed out map. 

You're helping to navigate with turn by turn directions?

-   yes, sometimes I do. We'll have them some place written down, then I'll have her read me the next several directions. I can remember them to repeat back to her when she needs to. Sometimes I'll put them on my little victor stream player so I can play them back as we go. 

Is that an app?

-   It is a free standing little, like the size of a flip phone that you can put books, or notes or text messages on. 

You eventually found the VA. what could have been better about that?

-   If the VSA people gave us a simpler set of  directions, there were a lot of turns but after the interstate it was only 2 turns. Then us getting more practice using the map service on her iPhone. We have 2,900 people in our community here so you kind of know where everything is. 

Have you ever used the VA.gov website? 

-   Yes. I have used myhealthevet, I use va.gov, I use to have to use eBenefits - that was terrible. Mostly, myHealtheVet is how I go in looking for stuff for the va health but occasionally I'll have to go out and look up some other information...forms...find out about some programs that are available. That usually works pretty well. A lot better than it was 5 years ago. 

If yes, can you tell me briefly about the last time you used VA.gov?

-   I can't remember having a problem the last few years. Usually, If I know the form number or the name I hit it pretty quickly. Sometimes I just don't know what I need to be looking for. But that's not the site, it's not knowing the correct terminology. They have it broken down. From my point of view MyHealtheVet is a little too tiered, you have to go to too many places to get to someplace you want to go every time. VA.gov has gotten a lot better and I haven't had many issues in the last few years. 

TASKS
-----

### Task 1

#### Getting to 'Find a VA location'

Next, I'm going to ask you to complete a task.

Could you please find your nearest VA? Imagine you don't know where it was.

1.  [laughs] since I've been going there for 20 years. If it were me, I would just pick up the phone and call the local VA office, the toll free number.

Why is that?

1.  Just because it is the fastest way to get an answer. There's good staff there, their friendly. Again, even that has improved over the years. Say, If I wanted to look up one of the blind rehab centers, I would go to va.gov and then look for blind rehab. I have been to several of them but before I go I need information about them, what's surrounding them, what kind of programs they have. I can usually do that on va.gov but I haven't done that in several years so I don't know what's involved now.

Can you show me?

-   [user minimizes all windows and opens a Brave browser window]

-   JAWS: "Address and search enter, address and search bar" 

-   [user types "va.gov"]

-   JAWS: "VA.gov Veterans Affairs, Brave,... official website of the United States government, page has 4 regions, 27 headings, 85 links, period. There are no edit boxes on this page"

-   "No edit boxes. That's the first problem I have that I run into a lot of times. I have to start looking to find something. 

[22:56]

-   [user pulls up JAWS Find, it announces, "virtual find" and types in "l-o-c-a-t-i-o-n" presses enter]\
    "Ok, I searched for location and it has 'Find a location'. That was not too bad. There's a list of different places and it has a location place. Types in little Rock AR. Facility type: community providers, that's one I haven't done before. Service type: there seems to be only chiropractor and optometrist and I have a community care provider I see here in town.  It say's there's supposed to be a list. And it ahs no results. Okay I didn't expect that. Theres on in little rock, I guess they want you to go to the hospital for those. 

-   Expect to happen: I blew it for putting little rock in, I figured they'd have a lot of locations then when they only has 1 type of service. Maybe because it is so close to the VA. I get to use community care a lot because I am 100 miles away and 50 miles for the clinic. It is nice seeing my normally doctor. This was easy to get into. 

[stops him to ask about all the links]

-   What choices were you referring to: They had a PTSD, female LQBT, homeless. The initial breakdown. They gave choices but none that I was interested in. Theres a crisis link as well. I clicked on refresh but it didn't read it to me this time, I would need to go back to it and restart.  

About scanning behavior: "With practice and years I [think to my self] don't need that, don't need that, don't need that. It takes so long to get to what I want anyway"

[Nearest VA:]

-   I think I would have at the choices I would not have chosen community care because it's not for va health care. If I click that I would probably get to where I want to be.

[Go ahead and find that for me]

-   [Starts scanning reading out links in footer] gets to FL from footer link.

-   [ctrl F and enters "med" to get to where he can search] takes him to "All VA Social Media" links in footer

-   [Gets back to FL link in footer]

-   Now it looks like I am in circles.

-   What were you trying to do: since I don't see pictures, or anything I look for a word like med. If it is on the screen I jump right to the word instead of reading through the entire page. If it works 20 percent of the time I still save time. 

-   No edit boxes: They have a list of things. I have never used this to get prescriptions. This looks like my standard myhealthevet, not the same page but the same things on it. If I knew I was looking for prescription I would search for that word and it takes me to that link. It used to be click on care, link, prescription, then refill. 

-   Where's that at: my HealtheVet but this looks like it links to it. I am sure I would need to sign in prior. Disability, maybe I am being told I should be 100 percent after 60 years. 

-   Not edit boxes: if in additional to this list, they normally give a box for you to type in what you need to find and I could type in doctor, regional office, etc. then it would bring a tailored list with 5-10 items that relate. It is just a shortcut. Anyone that is visual it is a waste but it is a shortcut for blind people to use. I just searched for part of the word and it took me right there. 

### Task 2

#### Using 'Find a VA location' near current location

[SEARCH]

Next, I'm going to walk us through a scenario. I'd like you to imagine that you've just moved to where you live today and you're looking for a dermatologist at your nearest VA. You can pretend that you don't know where that is.

1.  How might you do that on this page? I have to go through the 'mask' and the 'Covid' and everything every time. [laughs] They should put it at the top of the page. 

2.  [Enters zip code]

3.  [enters FT combo box and gets 3 choices in and backs up to VA health] I would want a va health facility, 

4.  [enters service type listens to them all until] Hey, there's dermatology.  The mileage is wrong. 

5.  [hits search, focus goes to results heading. Listens. advances to listing, hears mileage, goes back to results heading, and then back to 1st result.

6.  What wasn't expected: when it said 35.6 miles. I know it isnt that close it is about 52 miles away. I wouldn't have known that if I wasn't there a lot of times. They have the location, what center its in, the phone numbers. Limited services and hours. Oh this is the second place 43 miles. I don't know where they got these miles. I didn't even know there was a VA there. It did not come up with little rock so theres probably a mileage restriction they have. I know that they don't have dermatology in mountain home a few years ago, they may bring someone in on a month basis but they also due telehealth there and I have done that. That was neat. Here's the list I saw before. 

-   Can you try that now?

-   How does this search experience work for you?

-   What could be improved? Actually it was easy to do, the mileages are way off. I know the one that they say is 36 is wrong I get paid for 52 miles. It has to be at least that far. Other than that the infomration is good. Sometimes you don't even see street number anymore so that's helpful and the number. It says limited hours which may mean doctors come in a few times a month, that's how they do it here. My cardiologist come sup once a month from little rock to do checkups. 

### Task 3

#### Using 'Find a VA location' to plan ahead

Next, I'm going to walk us through a different scenario. Imagine you are planning a trip and you'd like to know what the closest VA hospital would be from where you'll be staying. It can be somewhere you've visited in the past if that's easier.

1.  How might you do that on this page? Types in little rock, Arkansas. Facility, VA health, service type: primary care. Entered. That's where I normally go. I just plug in the city and primary care and it showed me right where to go. 

2.  First time it was the zip code: for where I live and asked for care. Then this time it's where I travel to. Then of course it is 1.8 miles form downtown. It is pretty easy to get to. 

3.  Other information: I don't understand limited services and hours. I guess primary care is limited. When they aren't open for business they have a full blown hospital. It is unclear what limited services and hours mean.

4.  Anything else in results:  Okay this on is in north little rock and it is more specialty clinics, I have been there but not recently. I have been there as well and that's where it is. Pine Bluff is the other side I have never been there before. Hot springs is further away in is close to TX. I notice they have mental health on most of these it is probably more telehealth unless they come in short term. That area is doing well in teleconferences. My eye doctors cant do it by teleconference. Then when they do that they have a nurse there as well. They can handle that locally. It makes good use of the doctors time when they  do not have to travel. It went out a good distance which I didn't know about. 

-   How did this search experience work for you? This was easier, it worked the way it should. This page was straightforward. It had selection groups; some sites don't work with screen readers. This one does but others you cant get to the list working from a keyboard. No issues on here. 

-   What could be improved in this scenario?

[If participant did NOT interact with the map/list]

1.  I'd like to point out the map/list feature to you

-   Did you notice this feature? Don't have the word map on there but there were links that came out sounding like garbage so I went past those. It is bult into the screen reader and anyone can do through the keyboard, I click F and it's a jaws find, I type in hospital and it enter and it finds the next place on the screen. A lot of people, I don't see it at the va, the work would not be hospital it would be a picture word. They like to use unique fonts in paint shop and put it in as clip art. I cant tell you that sighted people tell me that its there but my software cant see it. 

-   Would a map be helpful: if it were one that gave directions turn by turn. Most on the web do so you can click for map or directions. That would be helpful. 

-   Under address theres a link for get directions: the words run together so unless you listen clearly you wouldn't know. Here comes google maps which have the direction options on it. running those two words together, I would have searched for direction and it would have found it but listening to it seemed like I wouldn't want to click on it. put an extra space and it would be fine. 

-   Link: I didn't expect it. going to google is common. Sometimes it will bypass that and go to written directions. 

-   What's most helpful: written directions for me but map for my wife and she drives. 

-   Does this page become written directions easily: they have added a lot to it. since I said little Rock it is from downtown. Okay since I haven't typed in an actually starting point it wont give directions, it gives the map so my wife could see where we are. I could type in an actual address to get directions. I think that is good they added other transportation methods. From what I have seen, they take safely into consideration. They just can't find where I live and there are serval maps that will take you to my house, downtown or 50 miles away with the same address so I normally provide the directions and they call me telling me they cant find me on the gps.

-   Apps that do a better job: I haven't used them enough to say. 

Post-Task Interview
-------------------

1.  Are there any features or functionality missing for you on this page?

-   Why? Why here?

3.  Are there any websites or apps that work well for you that do a better job of finding locations or searching?

4.  If you had a magic wand and could fix one thing about the features you interacted with today, what would it be? I think I would like a search field on the first page. Bypass a few parts to get where I want to go or not have to read what I am not interested in. reading fast I pass things that could be important to me. To be the fastest way to get to what I am looking for is important to me. The list of things they had I am not interested and most people wouldn't. once they have been working with the va you know what you want so give me a place to type it in and jump to it. 

Let go back to va.gov, top of the page has a search: Theres the search button. Okey theres my edit field. Obviously, it isnt limited to VA. I will look for the word search and would have done that eventually. 

Hidden but not expected: right. 

When opened it wasn't so easy: it looked like it wanted me to choose to from a combo list but it didn't open. I don't know what it was doing so I went up again and I found the edit field. A lot of websites have that issue it's a coding issue. Okay, it may have been just the word edit combo, that's not uncommon. Its ready to type. I heard the word and thought it was something different. It was hurrying on my part. 

Anything that could be useful or improved: the one place I have the biggest issue is secure messaging. Once I get into it, it is a pain. I can search the inbox but it doesn't take me there and then I have to get to the message and reply. If it is lengthy, I just open up a text file and go to secure messaging and that's the only way I can make sure it doesn't do something strange. Theres also a help link but it has never worked for me, I even call the line to get help. Secure messaging is a nice feature, I can make appointments or get supplies that way. It works well. My coordinator and I stay in contact in secure messenger and on the phone. I know she's out in the field a lot. Ordering refills is awkward but not bad. It was easier a few years ago. Right and I cant tell you why that is but the way it is presented and the information they are providing. Theres a lot to go through before you get to the prescription, one is ordered date and one is shipped. Sometimes they are meaningful but others are strange but you have to get through serval lines of code before you get there. I only do it a every few months and when its time they will fill them. It is a lot easier then when I needed to call it in and type in the numbers and trying to get them off of them computer. It is an improvement over that. I rarely need to call, rarely they will short me but right now its due to them running out of stock. I have had to call that in a few times. Most of the time now they put it on the label. That's not the website but that ahs improved as well. 

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

-   Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know? Right now I don't think so. With the exception of secure messaging I have seen a lot of programs. Sometimes it says take a survey and I will do them most of the time. As I am going through it, it will skip 4-5 items and tells you that you didn't answer them and maybe then it will skip it then again. It's not every time but it's often. It is probably related to jaws but I don't know. 

-   Last time: it was this year. It only missed 1 or 2. I say va.gov but I always go in through my HealtheVet. 5 years ago you'd pull your hair out trying to do this.  

Thank-You and Closing
