Facility Locator - Screen reader, Usability Test - P9
=====================================================

Tech set-up
-----------

Checklist:

-   Are you using a computer or mobile phone during our session today? Desktop.

-   Mac or Windows? It's a dell so its windows. 

-   Do you have Zoom installed? Yeah I use zoom tec. 

-   Are you wearing headphones today? No I just have the volume turned up.

-   What browser are you using today? I think she has it on Chrome.  

-   Do you have a screen reader on this device? Zoom text yes. 

-   Used for that: yeah. 

-   Are you using a screen magnifier today? Zoom text. 

-   Are there any other assistive technologies that you use? No not really, no. well I got that dragon. I use that once in a while. I have been trying to write a book.

-   Do you know your screen reader's speaking rate (verbosity setting)? High, medium, low? I am usually at 50 or 55 percent. If I use the slow rate by the time I get to the last word I can't remember the first word. The biggest site I have is everything is spread out to much like on va.gov. you get there and go there to login and have to go way down to the lower left to find login with something then agree and then come up with the login thing and the one login is in the right corner then have to go down to the lower left corner. If the screen is so big you can see it with the sight you do have you have to move the screen to see it. the thing is that if I have is small enough to see it then I can't see it. 

-   Can you show me that: I am using zoom tech right now. I go to my HealtheVet thing if I go to that will it bother you. I go there then sign in and that goes away then I have to go way down here to hit that then I have to go way over here to accept then back over here to log into it. We are back to myhealthevet now. 

-   Do you every make the window smaller: no it makes it harder. Sometimes if she is doing it on my computer she will have two screens, I cant see any of it. I have to make it big enough so I can see what is there and if it is two screens I can only see half of each that's why I don't do that. 

-   About yourself: I like to work with wood, I was on a few BRC's and they brought me back. It built my confidence up. In 2006 I drove over to the mall and she needed to drive back. I had to go take the test and I had to do an eye test and it happened that quick. It was a long expensive process but the va helped learn how to use a computer. I only knew how to plug it in. for me the zoom text was the best way to go, they had JAWS and others but zoom text was the best. 

-   Low vision, see partially: Right. 

-   Since when: 2007. 

-   Just on the desktop or on other devices: I can use it on the laptop. The iPhone doesn't need zoom text because print is big enough he can look at it and see it. I never got trained on it for voice over because of covid. Covid was supposed to be over so I got the iPhone and can make a call. I don't know how to use voice over with figure taps yet. 

### Internet searching for a location

During our time together, we'll mostly be focused on finding VA locations online.

-   Can you tell me of a recent time when you used the internet to find the location of a place that you needed to visit?  I was on a submarine and every two years we get together. Next one is in Philadelphia. We thought about taking the train because I live in Concord, NC. The train goes right up there so we thought about using the train so I looked that up. I used Bing and looked up Amtrak train to Philadelphia PA. I just picked on and hoped I got the right one and I did. It came up with departure times and the time it took as well as ticket prices.

-   Booked trip: no I did that last night when she was sleeping so we talked about it this morning. We searched this morning for a camera detector. My niece is getting married and going to gradea on their honeymoon. I have a friends brother that was in the air force and in every country they went to had hidden cameras. They are hidden in alarm clocks; they are smaller than the screw that holds the plate on. I heard they had them so I found it so we are going to get one for them to make sure they aren't being spied on. I don't think on a honeymoon you want everyone watching. They also have door alarms. We don't travel much anymore but that's when we would use it. 

-   Could you tell me about the last time you searched for a VA location? We were looking for a VA facility in SC. Some of that was confusing I ended up calling her down. It was confusing because they wanted to know, they were so many choices, medical, mental, eye center, all sorts of options. We had thought about moving to SC so he wanted to look for VA's because we would want to live near a VA. We are 25 mines from on and 45 form the other. We would want ones as close or closer. Going to Salisbury isnt bad unless it is winter and theres ice or snow other than that. I get closure warning if it ices or snows. 

-   Notice form who: I get a situation updated from the va

-   How: it comes through email. 

-   Like that: Yeah it lets you know what's going on like this entire covid thing. It came in and told you the gate was closed and provided directions on how to get in. it was nice. We had a friend that took his father up there and it took them 20 minutes to find out how to get in whereas we got the update. 

Could you show me that search that was confusing:

[43:18]

-   he goes to Microsoft edge, his home page is Bing. It comes up with the line he can fill in. types in va hospital SC. You get the map and it shows what they are, then you have all of these other things. 

[Is this what you meant for to many options:]

-   "The first one that comes up is the hospital, and the second one is the VA medical center, the third one is a VA medical center So, I mean, you just don't know whether they'd be able to go there for his vision or his primary care. There's Greenville, Charleston, Columbia and Myrtle Beach. When her brother lived in Tampa FL, and he had to go to the VA for something and about the only thing you could go there for was to get a pill and that was it." 

What would make it clearer for you: 

-   like it says Columbia health care system, under it,  have the services available there like primary care, emergency room, eye center, in addition to the hospital. And If all it is, is just a little clinic, say 'just colds and sniffles'.  See like, The second line, is a VA medical center, [at ours] they have a lot of things there. That's where he gets his primary, podiatry, vision, eye care, his VIST coordinator is there, low vision clinic. In addition to long term care and hospital. What is at that VA medical center, you don't know because it just says hospital. He doesn't do Facebook. They have a lot of Facebook. There's like 19 things on Facebook. We don't do Facebook.  This one says it closes at 6:30pm so, you know it doesn't have a long term care, and  it probably doesn't have an emergency room. Because then it would be open 24 hours a day.

-   What were we talking about this morning with MyHealtheVet? Oh, yeah, travel reimbursement, you have to go to a separate site. It's really weird; If you go outside, I had to go outside for that, for a sciatic nerve problem. Then you have to get a letter, and then scan that in and then attach it to the documents. It is eauth.va.gov/accessva, ok, go to that site and look for vtsss for travel and use your MyHealtheVet login to login but it is a different website. So first to that site then use your myhealthevet login and then have to go through. I mean, It is a lot of steps. Its nothing he should do on his own because it is all over the place and way too much back and fourth to even get to where you put in for travel. But what I said was it would be nice if they put that on my HealtheVet. Cuz they've got prescriptions and appointments and you can talk to your doctor, your records. So, to have travel reimbursement right there. Because the care in the community set up the care for his nerve treatment but they don't put the appointments on that travel site. If he visits the VA, its there automatically to confirm if you traveled. They know he has the appointment because they approved that.

-   They sent you there: right. 

-   If yes, how did you go about finding it?

Have you ever used the VA.gov website? 

-   Many just my HealtheVet. It appears that everything I need is there. I get newsletters from va.gov. I did sign up for that so I know what's going on. 

-   He also uses the DOD website. 

What for: 

-   it is to track the claim. 

TASKS
-----

### Task 1

#### Getting to 'Find a VA location'

Next, I'm going to ask you to complete a task.

Go to VA.gov. Look familiar?

-   No, I don't think I have ever looked at that one. 

Could you please find your nearest VA? Up on the top they have find a va location. 

-   Okay now it comes to city and state or zip code required. I put my address in. choose facility type: va health we will try. Service type: all va health services search. 14.5 miles north charlotte that's a clinic. So it came up with the ones closest then south Charlotte, rock hill. It is in order of distance. That isnt bad I guess. That is really good. At least it says north Charlotte va clinic so you have an idea that it isnt a hospital which is okay. then that says medical Center, it seems to me that they tell you they do more than a clinic. 

1.  Did you type it: at first when I clicked on it my whole address came up but only put in my street address so I deleted it and put in my zip code. 

2.  Results accurate: yes, pretty much. It had the miles and told you what they are. Second one is a clinic. If you click on it, it provides a list of services the provide there. That's good. And the page isnt so spread out. That is really compact so I can just about see the whole screen. Theres a map and hours of operation. I can tell it's the whole screen but I need to make it a little bigger.

3.  Can see with zoom text: yes easily. 

4.  Mentions it has services, anything else that could be helpful: the map is a little fuzzy but it has the hours of operation. That cant be any clearer than what it is. It has the hours as 24/7 but that might be because they have the ER and pharmacy. One thing it doesn't say that I have seen and heard before is that if you are feeling you have a heart attack go to the ER. Even though it says cardiology you don't go there for heart attacks. If you look at this it says cardiology but doesn't tell you not to go there. It would be nice if they has a dahs if having a heart attach call 911 and go to the ER. We had a vet in our group and they said don't go to the VA er because they can't help so I think that should be on there. When having a heart attach seconds can make a difference. 

### Task 2

#### Using 'Find a VA location' near current location

[SEARCH]

Next, I'm going to walk us through a scenario. I'd like you to imagine that you've just moved to where you live today and you're looking for a dermatologist at your nearest VA. You can pretend that you don't know where that is.

How might you do that on this page?

[1:03:17]

1.  There's a search thing there so I would do that. Types in VA dermatologist. 

When typing is the keyboard enlarged as well: 

1.  It is yellow with black letters. I recently had cataract surgery and they put on distance lens so the glasses I have don't work at all and my fingers don't always work too good. Theres on in phoenix, it came up. I guess I could add NC. There's nothing under neath of it, it looks like they are all in other states. That tells me if you need dermatology they would need to refer you to community care to find a dermatologist that is in the va system. 

### Task 3

#### Using 'Find a VA location' to plan ahead

Next, I'm going to walk us through a different scenario. Imagine you are planning a trip and you'd like to know what the closest VA hospital would be from where you'll be staying. It can be somewhere you've visited in the past if that's easier.

1.  How might you do that on this page? I would go up to that search thing again. Penn yarn NY. 

2.  I will have us go back and talk about it, you chose the search tool, why instead of the search sued the first time: I don't know the zip code. Lets try this. Canandaigua , Bath, Auburn,.

3.  Expected to see: yeah because her brother lives up there and we are going up for a wedding. Theres one 18.9 miles away. Again this says medical center and you have to go to each one to find out the services. 

4.  Expect either search, both work: I kind of thought they would both work. Why have a search if it didn't search. It seems like it searched outside of the va because outside things came up but when I used the find location it came up with what I expected. The closest ones then the map on the side for where it is. 

5.  Map feature, useful: If we were going somewhere we didn't know where we were going like SD. That map would be helpful, we know where the places are in NY. If you haven't been there before the map would be helpful because you would know the routes to get there. 

6.  How does it would with zoom text: well it depends. This one here is pretty good, I can enlarge it enough to read it without it pixelating. Other maps if I make it big enough I can see it, it becomes to pixelated that I cant read it but this on is really clear. 

7.  Features on other maps/websites that are useful or not useful: one place that is harder to sue is menus. If you are trying to check out a restaurant to try and read or see the menu in most cases very difficult. Most of them it is not a constant setup on the screen, most of them the reader isnt ale to read it. 

8.  Why is that: it is a problem with Microsoft and zoom text. They don't give up all updates without telling zoom tech then takes a year to catch up by then they make another change. It is an ongoing process and somethings it just isnt going to read. Something things that the app wont read but the speech will read it line by line if I do it right

9.  When successful: If I get on a website with a long news article. Like if I wanted to use it with this it wont read this. I just went offline a little but because now I cant find my curser. That happened when I went to use the reader. Sometimes it will come back on its own and sometimes I have to manually shut down the computer. That didn't start happening until work from home start.

10. Zoom give warnings that connection isnt stable: nope, we've had people come out and they installed. First they said the ceiling could be the issue then put in fiber optics and did that and here we are still. I am back. 

11. When entering the zip code, use my location: I never noticed it before. See then he clicked on it and it couldn't locate us. I don't know what happened. Maybe location sharing isnt enabled on the desktop. Now zoom text is back. I don't think I would ever use it. only if you were looking for directions to someplace, I don't think I would use it. No if I were looking for directions I would put form here to there. 

12. On phones, is it different: he said he wouldn't use it at all but I use it sometimes when I am looking for directions. When you put in where you want to go it asks to use current location and it gets the directions for you. I do it he doesn't. I put in form the address to the address 

13. Reason for that: That's the only way I knew how to do it, I have never seen the find location before. 

Post-Task Interview
-------------------

1.  Are there any features or functionality missing for you on this page?

-   Why? Why here?

3.  Are there any websites or apps that work well for you that do a better job of finding locations or searching?

4.  If you had a magic wand and could fix one thing about the features you interacted with today, what would it be? On the va.gov have all login stuff on the same side so it is in a row and not going form one side to the other. That would be the main thing. That's true with many sites. Just have it right in the row. You have had it then click login and right below it sign in rather than going form one side to the other. When it comes up to login it is on the other side of the page halfway down. When he had it big enough to see it you need to move the screen all over the place. 

5.  Zoom text tell you: No. if you cant see then you would need to wonder around until you find it. on some sites I sue it but with it blown up I can see good enough to find it but for those that cant and need to use the speech tool it can find it but it is annoying. When you turn it on it reads every word. 

6.  Thoughts: it is a good feature. It is really nice if theres a reason to use it. I used it after the surgery because it makes you almost blind during recovery. 

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

-   Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know? No, that one site we looked at was good because it was all in the row. Once in a while I will use secure message but it wouldn't give me a notification. Most of the time it come sup on email that I have a new notification but very once in a way I don't get them. 

-   Expect to get an email: yeah, I don't know if they forgot to send it or if it is automatic. 

Thank-You and Closing
