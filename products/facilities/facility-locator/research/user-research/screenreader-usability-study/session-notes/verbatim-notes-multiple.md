Verbatim notes taken by Josh, then organized with theming by Leyda

About:

"Totally blind" "I don't have any light perception"

"I'm 70 years old I'm a Vietnam Veteran... in 2002... I had a heart attack that when I came out of a coma I was blind and then a few months later I had a heart transplant. I got married... that's been going almost 29 years now, two kids, no grandkids. I could tell you more, but I wouldn't want to waste 2 hours talking about me haha"

Tech:

Gmail is his preferred communication method

Joining on a surface pro 3, windows machine

Wearing a headphone and a mic

Zoom goes through headset and JAWS through speaker

Uses JAWS, 2021, since 2002

"My internet connection isn't strong... would prefer no video if possible"

Screen readers

"Well... screen readers I use on multiple devices. JAWS on Windows machine, Voiceover on my iPhone."

"On a computer... or on an iphone?"

"On my computer, I usually don't find directions. Like point to point navigation? Yea... most of the time I would use my iPhone to do the grunt of the work because I use dictation. I use voiceOver with dictation. If I want to find a restaurant if I want to find a location I'll use dictation. 

If that's the location I want, it'll point me there, if it's not it'll point me elsewhere. It's the dictation function on the iPhone yea."

VA.gov

"Well most of the time I don't use VA.gov... most of the time I use my healthyVet."

Web searching behavior

"Well... I get less... bring it down a bit... I typically don't go to websites unless I get a push notification that something has changed. Ok? So if I'm on an email list... if it comes up with something that I'm interested in, I'll click on that link and it takes me where I need to go. I usually won't use a website unless I get a push notification. If I need information I'll go to google or edge to search for information. I need to be notified about it."

What he uses web for

"Well ok, I do alot of accessibility stuff. I create alot of word documents that are structured like that so if I need to find something on how to structure a document I'll search for something I'll look up how do I create a heading one in a word document or if I want to produce an ebook I'll go search that and it'll take me to daisy?.org"

"Yea of course I'd use google chrome and I'd type in you know... uh... the "blind center in palo alto" or the blind center in california and it usually will come up with something."

"Basically I used a hotkey, the windows key, and g, to go to google chrome and I opened up google chrome and when it opened up I was in the search box, so I'll use ctrl L to get to search (landmark) and then typed in VA locations and I used duck duck go as my search engine."

ISSUE: Couldn't set up share screen because screens were minimized. In case that folks can't share screen, have shortcuts for maximizing applications.

Too many things

"If I have too many applications running I lose track of what's running and try to keep them to a minimum that I'm using."

"I've hit G, gets me to google chrome. That gets me right to the search button so I'll type in VA locations."

[36:30] So typically when I got to a new webpage I insert F6 

[M: what is that?] That lists the headings on the pages. So instead of tabbing through the headings, I just like to list them".

"L" for Locations

"It's listing all the headings on the webpage... if I knew that the heading was VA locations I could start with first letter navigation there but there is no "L"

"I tried to see if there was a main heading for Veterans locations, I couldn't find one. Chances are now, it's not under a main heading, it's probably a link. So I'll hit escape, and do a insert + F6, (SR says "Links List") and that lists all the links on the page."

"My guess is that locations won't be on the main page. It will be a portal to a another page so I'll look for the link"

"So its "Find a location" so first letter navigation  [tried L] probably wouldn't help me too much because I would think of it as Locations vs Find a Location". Maybe I should think of it as Find a Location. So I could have hit the letter F to find that.

"I find locations, I hit on the link... if I'm not sure with JAWS I can hit the tab key and can move to that link instead of activating it and then I can read whatever information is beneath or above it. Depending who wrote the code"

"I'm back on the link, I activated the link and entered a new page. I'm on a page that says "Find VA Locations."

"If I want to find a specific one, I would probably... I did the insert + F6 to go to links and so I found "Find locations" and then I hit enter on it." It [SR ] says same page, link to content

"It says Find VA Locations, heading 1."

--currently scrolling down--

Right now it's telling me where the different locations are at, I can get information on covid

Now there's a search engine, search box telling me to search telling me it wants my location.

--Enters zipcode into find city--

--Gives permission to use location--

Put my zip code first, when I hit enter, it said the website wanted to use my location

"Now it's asking me to pick what kind of va facility... different type of cares for different facilities. I'm gonna ask for VA health."

[service type combo box]

*Laughing* That's probably true *laughs* It asked me to um.. uh... what do you call when you can't think of the word... for your searches where you..." It asked for 3 different types of requirements that i asked for but when I checked it out, it said there were none in my location because I put the wrong requirements in for it.. Although there is a clinic here. I put the wrong definition in for the medical center because it's only a clinic.... yea..."

"I don't know the definition of what those boxes mean... I don't know what I checked on. I thought I checked the right ones. Obviously I had the wrong definition of whatever those words were." [45:05]

[VA health / Primary Care]

"It didn't find a VA facility in las cruzes... but there is because I go there"

Plan a trip task

Let's see where I'm at

[SR: "Search areas on the map"]

"Well I can't use the map so..."

"Where are you now?" "Yea that's a good question hahaha." It refreshed.

[tries to get back] 

"So... I'm in Find VA Locations cuz I just checked it... (used headings)."

[SR: city, state or postal code]

"Now I gotta clear the search box..."

"I used insert + F5 to list the form fields that I can edit so... now I can go by hitting enter I can go straight to that form field to where I can put the zip code in."

Tries to clear location input

"It's not letting me clear it... it should have highlighted and clear it."

"There was actually an element that says clear it... but it's not a button." -- he might have lost the clear button because it appears and disappears on the page 

"Typically I'd go through what form fields are there, what headings are there, what links are there. That's what I do pretty typically."

"Typically a form field would highlight completely and then I'd be able to clear it by just hitting (space or enter). I shouldn't need a button to clear it." 

"What I just did was to make sure I was in the edit box."

"When I went to the combobox, it didn't take me to the top, primary care was the first one I heard." Primary care was pre-selected from last time

"I'm not navigating like I'd typically do it. Now I know that there is an all there I'd navigate to it, but otherwise I wouldn't know."

"Ok, so it came up with El Passo this time."

"Is it what I expected? I would have expected Las Crucos come in... but it might not even be in the list, it might be under El Passo."

"But that is nice to get it, there's a phone number and everything."

Get Directions

"I'm hitting the tab key now [in the search results], it says there's a button that will take me to the directions so I'm guessing some map will come up. There's a general phone e number too so if I was on my iPhone i could just tap on that and call it. 

I also hear El Passo VA Clinic Link... I don't know what that is.

"I clicked El Passo central and it really didn't get me to the start of the page... " [Focus isn't managed here, not sent to h1]

"I refresh JAWS and then I refresh the screen. Typically with JAWS I'll lose the focus when I go to a new page, so I need to refresh to be able to find the headings again."

"What I'd like to see when a webpage go to the heading 1 level. Heading 1, I feel should be the main reason why I'm on the page. Ok. Typically, sometimes it'll be a heading 2 or 3... and mhmm..

Exploratory behavior when entering a new page

"You know... when I go to a new page... it takes me maybe 10 or 15 minutes to get familiar with the page and what's on it ok? I like to experience all the elements on the page... you know... how many checkboxes there are... how many headings, how many radio buttons... I like to go through that. So I just get an idea on what that page is about."

"A few years back... you'd have a link that go out to where you have no idea where you're going... but now the links are more descriptive now. When I go to the links list view... so there's on this particular page there are 52 links and... so if I'm not sure what it does, so I hear "homeless Veterans" I hit my tab key it says "move to the link" on the page.

"Ok so when I moved to that Veterans it just takes me to that link and there's no other information on what I'd expect to see when I get to that page. I personally would like to see or have a little statement on what I'd expect if I went to that page. Like for the homeless Vets page, like would I really want to go there?"

"I tried ctrl + w... but guess it looks like it closed the whole thing. I opened up a new tab... but I should have used... the other key stroke."

"I thought it opened Central Passo in a new tab, I thought that's how I configured Chrome to do. I did it manually, but I guess obviously I don't have it that way. Sometimes when you get a Chrome update it defaults it back to what they think you should use and they never tell you. They just update."

"I'd go to google chrome to alt + f and then I can set up the settings there."

"But you know... my internet connection ain't the best and it just said it reconnected. So if I'm doing research or writing a paper and I have multiple web pages open and I want to copy and paste it to my document, I'd just have those tabs open so I could just alt tab through them. For some reason I can't remember the keyboard shortcut, I forgot what it is."

"Sometimes I forget, there's alot of keystrokes to remember."

Placemarkers in JAWS

"One thing that I'd noted that I like to do is that I like to use placemarkers with JAWS using the letter "K"

"But... typically what happens on myhealthyvet, I'll place a placemarker, but then I go back later and it disappears. It's there for as long as I have the session open and then I come back and it's not there. I'm not sure if I'm configuring it correctly or the webpage."

"I use narrator when JAWS doesn't work so I can restart the computer."

"So basically what I did was I went to google, I did the alt f and went to history and opened up duck duck go."

"Since I know I've been on that page, I'll hit the letter "V" for visited link and be able to find "Find a VA Location."

Dermatologist

"I know I won't look in El Passo because there isn't one... so let's go to Cleveland Ohio and see what happens."

Seems to be stuck on listbox for service type.

"It's not letting me check... dermatology..." 

Used "enter", but not selecting.

"When I try to get out of that box it's going to cardiology instead of dermatology."

"For some reason... I had to close that listbox by doing an alt up arrow."

"Yea, sometimes they will close if I hit enter, sometimes I have to use a select and alt up arrow to close the box." [1:19:31]

"I don't know how, but it gave me las cruces clinic. It gave me two phone numbers this time." [M: what location did you put in?] "Ohio". I went to see if it had Cleveland Ohio in there but I didn't get to it.

"I did authorize it to find my location"

Clear button and clearing fields

This time it did come up [M: the clear button?]

"The difficulty with that is um..."

"I'm not sure why we need that clear button... it's in an awkward position to find."

"70033 it's about a mile off"

Task 3

"I used a JAWS command to read if it was highlighted. It wasn't so I highlighted it. I'm going to hit delete. It didn't get rid of it."

[M: try to tab past without hitting enter]

"I'm in there for the first time and uh... I'm not sure how to do what you asked me to do... to clear out what's in there..." [he enters in Denver and tries to tab past] 

"This is what I need after this session... mental health care *laughing*"

"It kept my street address but it added Denver"

Search results - "Get Directions"

[1:21:46] Reading the search results and stops when he can't understand "geDEERayshons"

 and has JAWS spell it.

[1:30:51] "What's that say?" [switches from male to female screen reader voice] G-E-T D-I-R-E-C-T-I-O-N-S-T-O, [SR re-pronounces the words]. "Get DEER rations file " I have no idea what that it... Oh! it says 'directions'. [uses military spelling reader] There's no space between N and the T so when I read it. What I had to do was use the JAWS cursor and that  lets me navigate that differently than the PC cursor.

Trying to find map now *going through links list menu*

"No space between n and d for directions."

Clicks on Get Directions

"I am on google maps right now..."

"Yea I had no idea it was going to go to google maps, but once I was on at google maps it was OK. It said "get directions" but not "get directions on google maps." If there was a little more description underneath the link saying that it goes to Google Maps. "Some people don't like to use google."

[M: told him to go back]

How do I go back? If I do that, I'm going to close everything. See that time it opened in a new tab. I'm in google chrome... ok. So when I closed the google tab it opened in a new tab and when I closed it I used CTRL +  W and it went back."

Prompting user to try to find map feature [intentional leading]

OK there's nothing on that page that I can use a map.

[M: what else is on this page for you?]

"Hitting the letter "R" for regions. I get US flag. Let me see. I get three graphics on the page. No radio buttons.

*Uses regions with R in JAWS to try to find map* [Expected map to be a region, note from Josh: this may be because it didn't emerge in other lists like the links list and headings list.]

"I used V to use visited links."

"Actually, when I got there I wasn't sure what it was. It wouldn't read anything but of course, the question is can I find it again?"

Moderator asks about maps: Do you use maps on your computer?

"No, I just use iMap on my iPhone. "

M: is there any map functionality that would be helpful to you?

"Well I'd like a list view. So basically... I think google maps does that where it says go out to street number make a right hand turn go three tenths of a mile make a left hand turn on so and so."

"It doesn't have to be... graphics are pretty much... it's like putting an alt text on a graphic."

Proximity

"Which one is closest to my location so if you sorted it by how close it was like travel time... and that's about all I can think of. There's probably more but... for now that's about it."

--We might want to build in a break--

"you're working me too hard *chuckling*"

"we can go as long as you'd like *chuckles*"

"I thought there were inconsistencies in how things were laid out and the way i interacting with them."

"Again, I like that page to tell me why I'm here and you know... that kind of stuff. Typically if it's a website where I'll go from one page to another and it doesn't give me what I'm looking for, I won't go back because there's enough alternatives out there. But now we're talking about government websites.. .basically it comes down to push notifications again. I'm not going to go to a webpage... I guess because we talked about locations but... uh... again, I didn't go to the website first, I went to the search engine first to get there. So 

"Basically it's a push notification to go get information... but if I need information, I use google to get me where I go, so I typically don't go to a government website. I use my search engine to do that."

"How are y'all handling pdf documents?"

"Well the... pdf document or word document should be structured. I should have the same navigation capabilities as I do on a website in a word document or a pdf document. It should be the same. That's one thing."

"With google I can put a shortcut on my desktop, but with edge I cannot."

"I like to stay in one platform you know. One operating system. So that's just my preference. You can talk to five different people and get a different message on that one."

"When I'm traveling I just bring my iphone and a keypad."

"When I'm home I pretty much just use my iphone. I don't work anymore you know... but you know I will write some stuff some training stuff up I'll use my computer for that because it's much easier to structure a document."

"[Structuring documents] is just something I do... you know structure your word documents. So if you want me to start preaching to ya you know. *laughs*"

"People have to understand that a headings is not a part of style. Sighted people use headings for style, a blind person uses headings for navigation. Some sighted people will use a heading 2 style or heading 3 style, but it has nothing to do with the structure of the document."

"You can call me anytime if you have any questions. You won't have to even pay me for it! Next time I'll have a better internet connectoin where I'll be able to do a screenshare!!"

Verbatim notes taken by Josh, then organized with theming by Leyda

About participant

Older woman, wearing glasses.

[Comfortable with observers?]

Yes.

[Preference]

"Either way, doesn't matter. Text is good. Right here on the chat? It would be easier on the same advice."

[Comfortable sharing?]

"Yes, go ahead." "That would be fine."

[Tech]

"Currently, an iPad. I do have other options if we need to do that."

"I don't think... this particular one has it. I haven't updated it... I've been using... for one thing, I didn't know about voiceOver until ya'll mentioned it so I started looking at it. The iPad can read it to me. I guess I didn't know it was called VoiceOver. It says speak, that's all I know. Say if I want it to read a paragraph, I copy it and I say speak and it talks to me."

[Screen magnifier?]

"Not currently... uh... I tend to just do the two fingers when I pull it but again it's because I don't know about it. So I need to be clear about it... I don't have a visual deficit. I have a learning disability and I use adaptive devices for that."

"I can definitely tell you it's a big difference. I'm 65  just graduated from college, I wouldn't have been able to do it without any adaptive devices. You know just took 25, 40 years but I did it. *smiles*"

[Share screen]

"Actually no... I wanna learn though. I have zoom meetings."

"It says share broadcast, is that what I want?"

[Tell me about yourself]

"I'm retired army. Service connected 100%. So..uh, I have mental and medical issues. I found out I had a learning disability after I retired in 20 years and so I started college and failed after being very successful in service. They tested me in 1995... and found out I had a closed head injury and that's when I got accommodations after I failed and I became on the dean's list and periodically took classes and finally graduated with a Health and Human Services degree."

[What accom help you the most]

I still use them today actually. Either having a notetaker so I can pay attention to the lecture person and not have to figure out how a thing is spelt. Now remember it was 1995 when this started. And it was Recording for the Blind and Dyslexia they would get my books recorded for me if they weren't recorded so the VA helped me alot with voc rehab. When I was growing up.. reading comprehension and spelling was a huge issue, and spelling, of course... I found ways, I didn't know I was doing it, of figuring out what was going on in the world. I was in intelligence, so I was good at my job. I was my getting information in another way. I was in a desert storm desert shield. So... anyway... as a child I didn't read. It was a struggle for me. Now that I have got my accommodations, I read one book after another, it's like I'm starved for information.

Regarding to the VA just recently, they test me every 3 years to make sure my learning disability doesn't go away... I don't see how it would... but whatever. But they were able to give me the iPad to go to school. Because it has the capability to read pdf files, since textbooks are now online, like eReaders, I can read along with it as its reading with me and its just another means of giving me auditory, visual, you can stop it... it's huge to have the iPad for school.

[Do you take iPad in other ways outside of school or other devices?]

For the most part, I use my phone because...it's like a mirror image just a gobber screen. So, yes I take my iPad when I need it for specific things like to write. I actually lead a group, it's  called Arts for Vets, if I do a zoom I'll have an iPad. But my phone does so much, it's like a mini computer. It's very rare I don't have my iPhone with me. Absolutely it can be interchangeable and my mac is too (laptop).

[In this session, we'll be focused on finding locations, recent time question]

"Uh yea... I do it all the time. I google it and they have a website or they'll give directions. If I happen to be on a map program I might ask where's the nearest coffee or something."

[Audibly?]

Normally I talk into it with a mic. That little mic right there. I think it's recording me yea. Because my spelling is atrocious I tend to do it orally and it recognizes my voice. Like dragon, it had to learn my voice and my different... I have access? all over the world.

It's much easier now. I haven't updated Dragon in 2 or 3 years. Probably 11 is the last one so I don't know what it might be now. I think it would still work. It's a $100 a pop every time.

[Last location?]

Yea I looked for *chuckles* my... husband tends to do the driving and now I've gone to my grandchildren's house many many times. So I had nana responsibility the other day, I knew the address but how do I get there? So I put it in the map, and anyways, that's like way the map works. Like uh just a second... map comes up on my app phone. I think its Google Map. But I could have done it with any of the search engines. I could ask Siri too. She's very helpful. I finally started using Siri, my grandson taught me this. I had nana duty in colorado and so... he had medication he had to take every 40 hours and he had echo so he'd ask echo to set the timer for 4 hours. So today when I had this thing [call today], I'll tell Siri, ok Siri set a timer... it's reminding me, it's very beneficial.

Yea I've done it with google, any of them. [Audibly asking for directions to tech]

[Last time for VA location?]

Florida? I was kind of sickly, wasn't sure if I had to go or not. I needed to know if a clinic was down there. It was a standard answer, my go to, it would have been on my phone and I think it was Siri. One sec I don't even know what this thing is... it's like a globe... I guess I don't know what it is.

[Do it on ipad?]

[Went to search, typing into search.]

[Slowly typing va]

"It was spelling it out for me [V - A - L - o - c...]"

"Up in the search bar, I put in VA location, it was spelling it out V-A once I typed location it said location. In this case I knew how to spell it so I typed it in."

"As long as it has the mic on it I can use it [referring to icon on keyboard]"

[Moving into tasks, last time you went to VA.gov?]

I think in other research y'all were doing... so far not seeing that much difference. I usually go to eBenefits and then if I need something else it has a link... so I don't know if they are mirror images it seems to me like they have alot of the same stuff.

[Between eBenefits and VA.gov]

"I usually go to eBenefits... and until I did the research with this organization I had no idea how to even use VA.gov. But obviously it didn't engage me to start using it. I'm on eBenefits all the time to see what the doctors have to say about me, that kind of thing"

[How would you go about finding VA location]

Usually I'd go into the search bar [safari] right here... it's not letting me... the keyboard. I'll do it on my phone. I'm going to the search bar... I guess it's um... Siri? But I'm not saying that right. Anyways its a search engine, I would say to it, "Find the location for the nearest VA." Normally it does talk to me... well it came up with... I didn't get good answers. It didn't give me good locations. So I guess I put too much parameters. I'm talking to it. I think I had the volume all the way down. I'm gonna say "VA locations." And it came up near me and it gave me the VA I normally go to, Straton.

[Does that look like you're in a google search]

Yea it's like a google search. Yea.

[What now?]

Well it actually gave me uh... OH look! You can actually go to VA.gov. Isn't that nice? Uh, which I could do that, would you like me to do that? "Find VA locations is what it said there." so let's see... [swapped to iPad] So... this is giving me a hard time. It just says "Vaaaaa" [typing in V-A]. It's talking along with me as I'm typing.

Searched for "va locations" in google in Safari. "I would click on Find VA Locations... is that what you want?" [Might be some bias in facilitation now]

[Leyda keeping it 100, asks participant to use device that's comfortable for her]

Participant switches to phone.

"Ok, so I'm gonna go to VA.gov [on iphone]. It says if it would allow it to look for my location. Ok so I'm going to VA.gov, "go to va.gov"-- and initially it gave me mental health first and then VA.gov. This is google.com results."

"Ok so I'm going to go to Va.gov... and... now you want me to find locations. Is that what you want?"

[On va.gov how might you find your nearest va]

"Give me a minute because I don't know how to use this thing... .. finally all the way at the bottom there's a "find va regions and cemeteries"

"On "Find locations" and the options is "use my location" big brother is watching me *chuckkling*... so normally I'd type or say Albany NY. "Albany NY" stated and it filled in. I don't know what kind of facility... urgent care... VA health?"

[What would you choose]

"Ooph. Truthfully I think it's a pain in the neck. So I picked VA health and all va services. It also gives the opportunity for the map and Straton VA came in and it happens to be a hospital and not a clinic so it worked."

"It asked me to select what type of facility, but I didn't know, so I did VA health. And then what type of services, so I did all VA services. And then Straton popped up. It said less than .9 miles... that's wrong, that means I can walk there. It says .9... that's 9/10 of a mile, that's not true. I can't walk to it. What I'm saying is 9/10 of a mile... but I can't walk to Straton. It's about 9 miles, not 9/10 of a mile. One little digit!! *chuckles*"

[Why pain in the neck?]

It gave me too many options!! It says urgent care, VA doesn't have urgent care as far as I know. Community provider network only.. Pharmacy.. Va benefits.. Cemeteries. I mean there's big differences in what you're looking for here.

[Sheer volume of options, or not how to choose between them-- leading question here]

"And then it says service type... and what are the options.

[Then you get even more options... right, ok. Well that's helpful. I really appreciate that.]

Or you have to fill it in. One good thing that came out of it, I had no idea that you could find cemetery information on VA.gov. It comes in handy."

[M: What would have been and easier experience?]

If it had just popped up with Straton. If it had just gone. Instead of, it gave me these options. It didn't give me what's in Albany, NY until you gave it this extra criteria. It wouldn't go anywhere.  I would have liked to see .9 miles is such and such. 6 miles is such and such but that's more of a google search

[M: I see without entering facility type or service type, just based on your location]

"What If I'm in a crisis will I scroll through all this nonsense!? Call 911.  In fact, Straton came up first before VA.gov came up on Google." [anticipatory design wins out]

"I see something else here that drives me nuts. Even before you can find your location it comes up with a covid update. Do you want to know about your mask covering? You're inundated with it. All I want to know is the location of a VA thank you very much."

[Imagine you just moved to where it is today and you're looking for a dermatologist at your nearest VA, with that in mind, what would you do it]

"I suspect i'd go to specialist services... so wait wait... I'm going to back out to see if it gives me an option to do that. So I'm arrowing back [back button] to the initial... talk to crisis sign in to my account... normally I'd sign into my account."

"Okay. So let me see. I'm on the homepage... I'm looking for health care... looking for dermatology... well...  I'm on the homepage. The first thing says health care, but I'm going to click on something. It's not clear dermatology is here. So I might have to go back to Find VA Locations because it has specialty services."

[Why this first]

Well, I don't have a really good answer for that. It was a brain fart on my part? I'd like to change my answer. [Participant may feel some pressure during facilitation]. Now that I know how to find a VA... let's go back there... how did I do that... oh all the way to the bottom. Oh, so this isn't very... I'm scrolling through pages and pages... it would probably be 10-15 pages on hard copy... finally at the bottom it says find a va location, cemetery..."

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/6f4Ku-SgWd4aMABanqUuOXPPtBxsuCgnjlPaXU8BB8cW_rnlysiwLRBdxAhleIkvLsCT1M1hgS25BA6A-r7uY2r3GcmbTbIP56pk9jeg7zcfG7OgBb067Ps_29PxB7KtgJmkdvwb)

[On find a location] "the other way [not how she naturally started to go  about it] I wanted to find....[thinking] service type! And you said 'Dermatology'. I can't spell that so I'm hoping I can use the mic and guess what. The mic doesn't work. I'm going to put in health care first. Community provider. Chiropractor?  That's weird.  OK, so this is what happened. So because I put in, it was a toggle thing? A drop down menu, I put in Community Provider in VA's network, then it let me... it asks for service type and I'm going to use the mic and say. "Dermatology" and it literally types "Say Dermatology" [laughs]. Under Dermatology, it gives me a laundry list... and here we go: microsurgery... its like 10 things. Procedures... pediatrics... clinics... labs... pathology... and something called micrographic... well, anyway. So, I'd be at a loss... maybe clinic or lab? Honest to God, it doesn't give a regular... It makes you select. I'll do clinical and lab and see how it works... so it gives an option for a list or a map which is kinda nice.

The list was too broad. That's the problem. I didn't put a location, it gives you an option to click and use a location. It was too broad. I didn't tell them where I was so it searched all over god's creation. It asks me if it can use my location.

[whatever you would you normally do]

"Facility type is community provider in VA network. It wouldn't give me anything until I put in health care. The other reason I selected it is I don't go out of network. I'm not going to pay out of the nose. I made sure it was in-network"

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/MXGd-VjlVxsWR_tq5Sq-uR0a3vGlzF3XwrOdbok-pZuucyPJ4uqpVyhJcTsCZSwPa5Eh62HX4RL4m3FCIuWrVUsQ24ONz4B9JUiJTlsA0SLDMj9LW-m-j5gO1UgWOSeoPC10zMSf)

So, I really didn't get anywhere to be honest.

So, it knows where I'm located but I don't know where the Dermatology is located. So I was unsuccessful... interesting.  I don't really like it for things to locate me. As much as I hate big brother watching me, I know he is, you can't stay off the grid, not in real life so... yea... I like the fact that they asked me. Thank you very much. If I have to, so... it's just security you know?

[And did you try to put in your location]

I hadn't put it in. I just left it blank. And it wasn't' happy it wasn't giving me any information.

I use a mic... most of the time if I type it I fight with it with the spelling. I just assume, get it done.

"All services..."

You get something else when  you do that!! Ok, so I put Albany, NY. For facility type I just put in VA health. Because I'm not versed in that stuff. Then it gives me a whole list of medical health, covid vaccine... and then I found dermatology alphabetical! That was probably just as easy.

By the way, I can recognize the word dermatology, or I can tell you if it's spelled wrong, but I can't tell you how to spell it.

[M: so seeing it in the list would have been better for you?]

So under service type, it let me put in dermatology, but when I said it, it gave me too many options. Because I'm not familiar with Dermatology.

[M: why not put in your location first?]

I wanted to see what [the location box] would give me. I wanted to see what big brother knew. If they knew where I was.

[Next step?]

I'm still on the search. The next step is I'd close it down and I'd be done with it. I don't think we ever found out where dermatology was located. In truth. We talked about it. I'm given a map... there's a red dot... so it's probably Straton but let's go see. So, I'm using my fingers... For some reason when I click on the red dot it doesn't let me see what it is so I have to go there. So it is Straton VA. So that's the map. I'm going to view list. Straton. It also gives a VA clinic. What could they do for dermatology? It still says .9 miles. I know why! I didn't give my specific address... Let me go back and put my real address in. Straton is still legally in Albany, NY. Let me see if I put it in real quick.

Guess what it's 4.8 miles away! And I could walk it on a good day.  Ok so that's the problem. The hospital is still legally in Albany, NY. That happens to be about 5 miles away from me. That's why it was giving me what I thought was false information.

[Note from Josh: She might have been hesitant to provide address originally because of "big brother' concerns. Next time, maybe we could prompt folks to use a fake address?]

[What are you seeing?]

Troy, NY is like 7 miles away... way down 30 miles away are different clinics but they don't have dermatology... that could be a wild goose chase. A clinic? Because our clinics have primary care... MAYBE a social worker filling for a mental provider. Anything else, I'm very fortunate I live so close to a hospital, my clinic is in, it's called the red team. Everything is under one roof. I know normal clinics don't have all that stuff. Only because I've been around forever. But think about it, if someone didn't know that, somebody would travel 30 miles and then they'd send them to Staton!

It was a tad cumbersome but I got through it.

[What could have been easier]

Well... putting in my real address... I can tell you I'm a different type of person than your typical Veteran. This I can tell you.  People sometimes just throw down the phone if they can't find Dermatology if they can't find the information immediately. But I'm kind of, I think because of my learning disability, I've kind of had to struggle. It was kind of like a puzzle to me. So I didn't mind doing it. Some people will say to heck with that obviously they don't want to help. If it's cumbersome for people then, it might be a problem.

[When you first made this search um... I heard you mention the map]

It gave you an option. They are side by side. I went to the map first. It's actually on VA.gov. So for instance... it says 11 Holland Avenue it doesn't mean beans unless I live there. So unless I can see it on a map to see where I'm physically located right now... oh I see "get directions" I didn't see it the first time. That's very helpful. I think I used the arrow. Oh geez. Ok. Guess what I found. Let me see where I'm at. Oh oh oh ok. So. I accidentally clicked on it and it happened to have taken me to the Straton VA medical center and under that it says there it has the website and directions and there it says dermatology... but I honestly don't' know how I did it [got there]. I'm still VA.gov. I must have clicked on Staton. Let me back track.

"So Straton is highlighted in bold... and then I clicked on it... but before when I was doing it BUT I didn't think about clicking that. I think that's what I'd call a brain fart. I guess I'm not too engaged this morning. So now that I'm looking and paying attention it's highlighted, it's bold, now that I've learned through computers that if I click on it it should take me there. But it also on that same page, actually there it has a phone number and get directions. I didn't pay attention AT ALL. So I guess I just need to slow down!"

[Note from Josh: May need to reconsider how this is designed to be easier for folks with cognitive disabilities to scan through, participant didn't notice get directions or number, may be due to how these are chunked/repetitive]

Ok so I went back to homepage... menu... so now I know that it's located at the bottom... I'll scroll all the way bottom. So there's a map there [on find a va location] I would use the map! Let's do the map. So you got the whole united states, so I'm going to florida... and I kinda know it's around tampa so... it might not... I dragged my map and I hoped to pin it, but it does not like that. So I'm going to say, "Clearwater Florida" Ok and now it goes back to the same thing... you gotta know the type that you're looking for... so here... I was dehydrated so I'll put Urgent Care. Hmm. So I said clearwater florida... it asked for type of facility I put urgent care, then it asked for specialty so I put urgent care as well... they all can't be... I'm going to do uh... I'm touching search. List... ok so... those are civilian Urgent Care that's the difference they're not VA facilities. So I'm uh going to go back and... urgent care... 

[why go back?]

Well I'm retired... I'm entitled to VA services so I'd prefer to go to VA facility so I don't have to pay out of pocket, everywhere you go it's always in your records, it's a means of following your medical and in truth I don't even know if there's a VA in clearwater so that would be a good thing... so I'm going back to "VA Health" [instead of urgent care]... I'm going to put primary care... it's a general station... One would think that would be a clinic... alright!

There is a primary clinic 9 miles away... whatever my issue is, are they going to be handle it at a clinic? But I do know there's a VA medical center 10 miles away. So depending on my problem I might want to go there. Well. Like I said. The dermatology, will it be at the clinic, or will they just going to send me to baypine medical center which is another mile down the road.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/fSEC8_deIOeBU65L1xQ0JsoOVXxJGmj4iNLBSOkf2jcJe_77KFxcr4PrtK2qwfy_FUqAPjdjK7rCj8yt5NlAH4HONuinDyRfPKVKBLxdmSeiREiN4tFRuJ_zWfrMTfl7D2qHDRAT)

There's another, St Petes! 15 miles away. I guess that's a good place to go.

[M: When this happened what did you do?]

When I was there and did this, I used google. I wasn't aware of VA.gov. Its education.

[!leading question, would google do the same thing?]

Most likely I would have called them to know where to go [after a Google search]. I'd call them, or I'd talk to a nurse to see if they have what I need. I think google would have done the same thing.

[how did you clear that box from whatever was in there before]

There's an x. Then it xes it out and it becomes blank. And now that I think about it, not that I would have done it differently, clearwater is pretty big, how would they know where I am physically? To be clear, I might have put the real address of the resort I was in. Because then I'd get a different answer. So.... I don't know what the address is. Uh... *sigh*

So. I think with the VA.gov it's a... I would have to be retrained. You gotta do it for 30 days before I have it embedded in me ya know? If I'm being taught something so... I think it's a matter of getting used to VA.gov...

[Any features or functionalities missing for you from find a va location]

Let me look. I don't think so. It's not obvious to find a VA location from the homepage. I had to scroll down to find it.

I think it's fairly important so I'd have it on top! So like under healthcare [4 main boxes]... [reads out stuff there], why can't it be there? Like "Find healthcare" right there? That's in the first paragraph [box], right there? Yea! Yea! I would think.

[Leyda nudges to open menu]

Oh... [opens menu] oh it is! Aghhhhh Urgh... *laughs* So the answer I'd expect it to be under menu, and bygosh it is.

[So it was more obvious at the bottom so that's helpful for us to understand]

Mhmm.

[Magic wand]

Instead of under the menu, the first thing.. Oh, there's a search bar too... geez. It's like I'm just coming awake. Anyway, to answer your question. I'd prefer Find a VA Location at the top before covid vaccines. Like you go to the top. Now that I see search... I'd like to see if it happens for me there.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/fVYlgdWFmjAf5suOYdoMfkuXx8tEwptIRJuOydch6skMg_8TsSMy0A8orc9S_OX-AS0Hj82HHkEOK38giauLcg5hBKxdNhFoc8qDCZKYAd_rf4fy4kErvmw_ZyQ-ly5M_tKGA1Ea)

[note from Josh: search isn't very visible here]

[goes to search and says "find facility", maybe just "facilities"]

It gave me travel pay... reimbursements... va funding projects...

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/zCLGp3KC-bX8rR8s4r_kdAmjQSerqIPb7J9Z0K5cbc6NZ7SJ5IuU0iTvSNwICV20cI5lvehvbffQxNXZjURBQib_zt3NvshTdGhzdA6ViKRhvNed_0wODviKYcG7OjNdh7Zpfr6n)

So they're using the term 'find location' when I asked for 'facilities' they didn't like it [didn't notice top recommendations], it seems like if you use different words people might use... for me it's like facility maybe if I put in 'VA clinic'? I just I think... "location" is a little weird truthfully. 

[what's weird]

Anyway I just wouldn't search like that. Say if I'd do google I'd "find VA clinic, find VA hospital" I wouldn't ask for a location. Anyway, that would be my answer for what I'd change. I'd put on the homepage above COVID.

[Any questions for me?]

No I don't have any questions for you. I guess I don't need to get wrapped around the axle about it. Uh... voiceover? It's automatically off again. Phone yea. Mhmm.

Verbatim notes taken by Josh, then organized with theming by Leyda

[Comfortable with observers]

"Sounds good!"

"Where you located at?"

"I'm in Brooklyn, New York *chuckling*, I can only imagine it's warm down there in Georgia."

"One question before we start, how long you been doing this, how long will testing take? I mean overall project."

[Preferred communication?]

"Right now the best way is to send me an email and then if you stay on the phone while I'm going through this right? That would be preferable because... let me check one thing, wanna check that I have plenty of juice. Yea I got 81% so I'm good."

"I can always put you on a stand, it has a charger built on it so I won't run out of power at all."

"What I'll do is I'll go back to my inbox and then I'll tap on that link and go from there."

"If it ain't broke, why fix it?" [Talking about his email address]

[Recording ok?]

"I'm more than comfortable... I did want to ask one thing tho, there's one little issue with compensation for the time... could you clarify that for me? I think it's like 50 dollars tho?"

[Tech]

"I could put some headphones on if you need to do that." [No headphones or other hearing AT]

"The only one I have is the default voice on the iPhone, I think it's by default."

"Uh... I've had this iPhone for the better part of three years... oh my god yea. It's the iPhone 8."

"It's just purely VoiceOver... I can't read the screen persay because I have low vision."

"It keeps locking!"

[One hour set up]

"Gotta get a piece of gum because it's too early to be drinking"

[About]

"I'm redoing my kitchen, how's that."

"I say this is camp pollack, how can I help you?"

[Tell me a recent time you found a location you needed to visit]

"Oh... I use the phone all the time and ask 'Where am I' and it will tell me things like... uh... you're in New York!! 'Where am I in New York' If I'm looking at 55th of 57th I'm looking for it to tell me 57th street facing south, north but it just says "you're in manhattan""

[Ever been helpful?]

"Not really... I have an excellent sense of direction. I use some landmarks to help me. And that's been my guiding post but at night... I've learned it's totally useless. I have to operate in the daytime in order to see those landmarks otherwise I can't see them and I've spent hours in the evening struggling to get home a couple of times cuz it got dark and the phone was no help. It would say "you're in brooklyn!""

"And people look at you, they don't know if you're trying to attack them or if you're mentally ill but it's like no I'm just trying to get to downtown brooklyn... thinking back to one time it was just really scary I got in a bus and it was like being in the twilight zone. The phone would not help me it could not help me at all."

"If I knew where I am, I could map out where I could go to find transportation or someone's home or how far away from my destination."

[How would you map that out]

"Generally if there's places I've frequented before... since I was a child I used to bike all over the city and I didn't realize when I learned how to drive I didn't realize how reliant I was on certain landmarks. You can't mistake where the empire state building is, you can dictate where you're going north south east west... it helps me get around, I know exactly where I am. Whereas, where I'm at rockefeller center I know where the trains are I know where everything is. It's pretty much... another one is the uh brooklyn public library, no problem can get around that really easily. I use landmarks as the main way for where I want to go and where I am right now. And from there I can go anywhere I want in the city."

Leading question

"I would try to dictate on my phone [where to go] and it will sometimes say you're quarter of a mile from what your destination is. I know cuz when I'm in a cab it will say... use a ride to your destination or you'll hear a thing like tadah you're there but my phone doesn't do that. It would be helpful as just you just did, you're so many feet just keep going to the left or the right."

[Last time to search for VA location] little leading, he may have never done it based on previous context

"Let me see if I can give you an instance... yea I've asked "how far is 23rd street from my location." It told me "you are six something miles from manhattan VA."

"Right, I say "how far is 23rd VA hospital from my location"" [knows his location already], and it will say "6 miles"

[1:00:31]

[Have you used va.gov?]

I have never. I have never used VA.gov website ever and I haven't been a member of myhealthyvet... I know it's there, I just haven't used it. I think probably the reason is this. Telling someone to go to a site doesn't help. What helps is someone here, this is the VA myhealthyVet, let me walk you through it and show you some of the features of it what you can find by clicking this by going here. There have been no tutorial. Telling me to go to myhealthyvet is like... and what? Now. I'm not po poing the people who worked on it but if you have some social worker or someone spent time with us... I'm sure there's a treasure trove of information there, but telling us to go there ain't enough, telling me to go there but what? I'm sure there's important info for me to unearth there, but what? Just like you did right now, guiding me in that direction, then I can learn ohhhhh, that's why I want to go to that site. But by telling me you can go to myhealthVet, most guys shrug their shoulders. That's not enough information. You need to literally sit down with people and show them some of the content there, maybe they will use it more.

[getting tools but no training]

 But if you don't instruct people on what's there... let me explain to you something that pisses me off, the VA spends millions of dollars on equipment, they gave me JAWS... well you got it, good luck! Well now what? You're talking about a very sophisticated piece of equipment, but how do I use it? You're a programmer right. Luckily enough I have a guy named Mike O Brien who is also blind and he unearthed some of the features of it. You know as well as I do, there's thousands of people putting together a program, I'm not an expert in it... there's hundreds and when you finally create the product you want us to utilize it but that's not always the case. I'm still learning about JAWS. There's so many features. You need someone, as long as a Veteran is willing to take the step, GUIDE ME THROUGH SOME OF THE FEATURES THAT ARE IMPORTANT! If you don't have... if we don't have a guide, we don't care how great the equipment is. What goos is it if someone can't speak your language and tell me how about things I don't know. "Oh my goodness look at that!" "Oh hey look at that!"

[How would you find VA using your phone?]

"Nearest va... hmm... if I didn't know where my nearest VA was... assuming I didn't know where they were at all. Uh... one of the things I'd do is um... uh... I would call and ask, I'm putting myself in those shoes... I'm new to NY I don't know where the VA is. I can dial 311 and ask them. OR, if my desktop was working properly, I would google nearest VA and boom it would give me certain locations of where they are. Or I could ask siri, "where's the nearest VA" and it would give me a selection 23rd street so forth... I can't do it with you on and siri now.

[Starts siri]

"No, it won't work. But if we weren't in session I'd ask Siri, "where is the closest veteran's hospital." And it would tell me. Then I can either get directions or call."

[you mentioned Google, do you ever dictate or type?]

"Dictating it is problematic. I have a wireless keyboard which helps me tremendously because little screen... the bottom of the screen, if you can imagine one third of the screen at the bottom, the letters and numbers. And for those people who are really cool and really good at this, they go through this V tap tap A tap tap and spell the word hospital and search OR you can dictate it and say, "nearest VA hospital in new york" and it will come up that way. You have a number of options there."

[Do you use external keyboard with phone?]

"Yea I do."

[Can you do that today?]

"I could use my wireless keyboard. That would be a lot easier."

[Turns on magic keyboard with num...]

"So the magic keyboard is connecting right now. I'll tell you when it's connected. Bluetooth technology is the greatest, boy I'll tell ya"

[Task: pretending you don't know nearest VA. Try to figure that out just using VA.gov's website.]

"Ok hold on. I'm connected."

1.  Double taps and menu expands

Because search means a lot of things for different people. But if you put something very direct, "What are you looking for?" and then colon, umm mental health, pharmacy, this that and the other. Search is a term that's used for programmers and people like that. The search could be very vast but help you narrow down.

"I'm glad I can finally connect with you... believe it or not I've been trying to do this... See VA is a teaching hospital, the more info and data you have, the better you can serve us. OK. I get it. Yea. We're doing this exercise so let's say.... The reason why I'm saying, I'm trying to make it plain. If I'm a 90 year old some Veteran. I may not be familiar with all these things. But I know the term, "What are you looking for?" That's very direct. Search might be a little... search uh I don't know. Like, "what are you looking for?" And a person would say, "I'm looking for *blank*" I'm not trying to think of someone who... I'm not an expert on the iphone... but if someone was much older than me... it could be a bit problematic. For those who are younger... see you have a difficult job because you're trying to cover and correct me if I'm wrong several generations of us. There's Vietnam Veterans uh... WWII Veterans... but they may not be computer alert. So how do you cover that much space cuz you got... for example I have another [OrCam](https://www.orcam.com/en/), but it allows me to read text where I wear a pair of glasses and it reads the text for me. Guess what, some Vets can't do that. I said "oh that's a great device for all of us!" but nope it's just for a select group of us. My point is, by using words that people are familiar with, not computer terms but terms people are familiar with, I think that would be helpful because then they'll know.

[Post chat]

"Siri is AMAZING! She can do everything!"

"Patience is so important because it allows me to focus. If you raise your voice or gets angry at me, my focus is shattered. It's gone. And I can't get it back."

"There means nothing to me. Sometimes people get angry at me. They'll intuitively point in one direction or another, I can't see where you're pointing."

"I think y'all did a good job. Given the fact that.... You've callen me, never spoke to me, trying to navigate me through... well first off my desktop didn't work, so let's go to the iphone, you were able to switch through technologies. So I don't have anything to give y'all. I feel like we were able to complete our goals."

"Here's what you did correct, I got a text from you last night-- hey tomorrow it's gonna start. I knew 9am in the morning I'd get a call! Then when I saw this spam call come in and I called the number and I connected with you. If I didn't know a call was coming, it would have went past me."

"I might have combined the person the night before and ensured they'd be there in conjunction  with the message."

[About]

[Tech]

Text is easier. I haven't been ever been on a zoom meeting and navigating a website on the same time on a phone.

I usually just use voiceover on the phone.

[Others?]

As far as screen readers? No.

[How long?]

Probably about 10 years?

[On computer, what would you use?]

Yea I use fusion, it's JAWS zoom based flexibility so I can get some enlargement or I can just have uh JAWS.

[How long?]

About the same... actually, take that back. Fusion I just started 2 years ago, JAWS I started about 10 years ago.

[Screen magnification]

Uh I have the bold setting in the large print, but anything beyond that, no.

[When you do use VO, do you have a speaking rate preference or a verbosity setting?]

You know, I don't really change it on the phone. I keep it at stock since I don't use it often. I do most of my web stuff on the computer. There I speed it up at maybe 70?

It could be a bandwidth thing... I'm not exactly in the best location.

My computer is a year old, but for some reason it acts liketen  years old. Yea... microsoft teams is still running...

I got this machine right before COVID at heinz. I haven't updated fusion since. I don't think there has been...

I usually use Fusion...

[What happens when it doesn't work?]

Then I default to zoom text or I stop using a computer.

Jaws talks really slow...

[Note from Josh: need to debug Fusion]

[Do you usually Firefox?]

Internet explorer has lots of bugs... Edge just isn't working... and google chrome has lots of popups that block things from opening.

[Tell us about yourself]

Uh... I don't know. I'm not very tech savvy. *chuckles*. I don't know... I have a visual impairment. I have some central vision based on the light. If i'm really desperate... sometimes website are so frustrating you just gotta suck it up.

[How does zoom text help you?]

It depends... I use Fusion so I can do both and it toggles really easily. You know I typically use the enlargement when I know the website or when I want to look at a photo. JAWS is helpful when I'm searching or on an unfamiliar website or layout. If I do searching because JAWS can go through everything and it's easier to find stuff if I'm unfamiliar with the website or the content. It helps me find things quicker.

[Tell me of a recent time you used internet to find a location you need to visit physically]

I was looking up a fishing location in North Dakota for a friend.

[Last search behavior - switch from phone to computer]

[What device/tech used]

For that I started out with  my phone, opened the app, got the address put in or the city put in and then I went to the computer um... cuz I wanted to look at the biggest town next to the city they were looking at and then I looked at it on my desktop computer to Google events. When I'm looking up a location a phone is more convenient and easier.

[Dictation]

[how so?]

The search feature, I don't have to wait for it to boot up. Siri is there.

[how do you use siri?]

I use siri alot to just open different apps, set alarms... um... once in a while you can ask a question like... but I like that you can ask a question and she'll bring you to an internet page close to what you're looking about [does Siri work well with VA.gov?]

[last time search for a va location]

Yes... but... not too... um... uh... I guess, searching for a VA location, I already know where they are where I need them. I've been to the main website alot but typically if I need urgent care I just call the nurses line, it's faster. [Leyda note: urgent care - is fastest via nurseline]

Uh you know if you call the nurses line and need urgent care, you give them your address and they give you the closest location from you. I think that can be automated on a computer, but I don't think they can do that. I think there's a list of clinics by state... but if you're not sure exactly all the different city names, it's very difficult to locate the one you want.

[Was that recent?]

Yea, it was a month ago.

[Closest is 45 away?]

Well we're in the middle of nowhere, that's why the connection is bad.

[Have you ever used va.gov?]

Yes. I used it more when I worked for the blinded vets but that was like 4 or 5 years ago and I did that because you had to find VIST coordinators you had to find things for other veterans, you had to figure out how to help them to find out who to contact.

More recently I'm dealing with my husband's parents. Their elder issues? So we've been looking at burial information on the website and some basic you know vietnam area qualification things to see what to do.

[When you were searching for burial info, how was that?]

Slow and cumbersome? I think the problem is there's SO much information that it's hard to get to the exact spot I need to be. So... it's not just like I can ask a question of "Texas Vietnam Vet eligibility for burial sites in Texas through the government." Instead I get, if he dies at a VA facility you get you get "X" # of dollars, if he has a service connection you get "X" # of dollars. There's this list of 100 cemeteries they can be buried at. It's alot to sort through.  Visually it would probably be faster? Hence, I had to get off my computer for a little bit. The other problem is... *sigh* how it was listed out, it didn't say where exactly the different cemeteries were... I mean it did, but you had to look up in google maps every time to know where this is. You know. They can say "it's in a hold up suburb in austin texas" instead they just list this town name... for alot of us out of state or unfamiliar with our current state it's really a challenge.

[note from Josh: alt text? Descriptions?]

[Find your nearest VA, imagining you didn't know where it was]

TASK 1
------

[clinic vs hospital]

You know. The question is. Is it a VA clinic or a VA hospital?

[Hmm...]

That's the main thing. Am I looking for a VA clinic next to me?

[I'll let you decide.]

Ok. We'll just put "VA facility near me...actually [erases me and changes to] fairfield, texas" (places in firefox search field) (searches on google)

(Texas - Locations - VA.gov is first result)

"It hates me."

"Texas-Locations-VA.gov"

I usually pick the first option [google search] gives me.

And then you get into this list of.. where are these places?

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/c0cCt3oKzINtNP7IcLofv2AN4fUoYweuqqkeTbd76VSqPxN9dOCglgK8CaL3pMi7o_Zvpyr7ysnC17lSwpcE7YV8NpJLpFmeXYAvaWXO1OdppSDnoDOXGPmfs8b2nBkWbSzd0_Yy)

[34.54]] "I know there's a location finder... but I don't know where that is. I don't even know what that would be called. You're hoping somebody labeled it right.

[M: If you want to find it, where would you go]

I would tab through this entire page one by one to see... or I would check the links to see if there's a link to.... I don't even know what it's called. So you're hoping somebody labelled it right. *sighs* I don't know. I guess I would listen to the whole thing... tabbing through or just check the links list.

[Want to try that?]

Ok...

"NUM LOCK ON. LIVE TRANSCRIPT ON." (JAWS)

[Turn transcription off for screen readers]

"NUM LOCK OFF"

Am I on JAWS?... I'm trying to insert + f7 to get my list links up *frustrated*

M: It doesn't seem like I'm in firefox?...

[GLOBAL NAV]

ok I can tab through normally... *activating VA benefits and health care, but it's not working* *LAUNCH BLOCKER, try to replicate*

[JAWS SR says:] ..."Sign in button, "navigation region", "Vah benefits and healthcare collapsed, vah benefits and healthcare collapsed," 

[starts to read a 3rd time and skips to left nav] 

"I am a dot, dot, dot, combo box, select one, to change selection, use the arrow keys"

"Locations home link. Locations home link. Locations home link"

[37:43]

[What's going on?]

I'm in the page! And I can tab easily through... but I can't get a list of links for some reason. I don't know why that's happening. I want to pull it up so I don't have to go through each one. Like what is subprogram?

I'm already ON facilities by state? Can't it say like "facilities by state, you are here?" So maybe it's the interactive US map?

"My reception is really bad... that's why I didn't originally sign up for this."

[Go to VA.gov the main page for me]

Why is it not going up... "VA LINK" I don't know what's going on with my keypad... my insert key doesn't seem to be sending me to where I want it to. "BLANK"

"ALERT LIVE TRANSCRIPT ON"

Right now I just want to get to the search menu... but it doesn't matter, I'm at the top. I just need to... "Veterans health location link, VA LINK, enter, space"

[reaches VA.gov]

[I see we've changed pages... on VA.gov, 

[M: if google landed you here, how would you find your closest VA on this page]

If google landed me on the initial page? You know with JAWS, I just tab through each page. 

[has JAWS read through page then changes her mind...]

[Uses search] "I'd do a search first cuz I'm lazy" "Locations" tab to search

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/grs04b5UtVr4BvoMbdC0l65e_M1vnhLmI4lI44F0BPyZGpLEML6eKGHqCsW3BvaipElIoDjdZoV7hWMwlPDCMSGN9f5Gg94m20h6Iv0S43BP-h7iUKcV7-rhkrnxw5NQl-zT51Xf)

"CONTACT US LINK, SEARCH BUTTON TO ACTIVATE" [JAW: press space bar, space] 

(laughs) I think I'm hitting the space bar? But it doesn't seem to be searching for me...

Yea I mean, I wanna search locations. So it's not working, so I'm just gonna skip it. "Find a VA Location link" [Space]. Tried to use "space."

"So in the search box, it said I can hit the space bar to search but it wouldn't let me do it."

[M: And then what happened?]

[USER FINDS "Find a VA Location in global nav" while JAWS is lagging]

So now it has the find...[FL is loading - JAWS is laggy]

Yeah my inserts and F6's and F7's are not working. Yep. It's not functioning... but you know that's just..."

[Tell me what you read?]

"Yea I'm in the wrong spot."

[Uses ctrl + f to search the page using "locations" on the Find VA Locations page]

[What page are you on?]

Right now I am in a... Find a word piece and for some reason I'm struggling to get out of that and now I'm back to the main VA page find VA locations.

[user wants to give up and switch to visual method with fusion that isn't working]

So at this point I would just stop using JAWS and use Fusion to zoom in. Because I don't know...

"Use my location button"

[Types in zip code]

"Choose a facility type"

[VA health] [enter]

Service type

[Selects all va health services and searches]

[Using `tab` to explore results]

Is it giving me GPS coordinates? [laughing]

It didn't say phone number! *chuckling*

It goes from get directions, then it goes to 903-723-9006- it gave me numbers so my brain went to GPS directions. It should have said "phone number" or "clinic number" or something to call them!

[Josh: Aria-describedby?]

[What else on this page?]

You know, I think that's the main problem. It's alot of information. It's overwhelming and if you're not working with JAWS everyday, your skills go down. If you don't use a computer every day, your skills go down. The VA tries to put too much information it just becomes overwhelming.

The other thing is... it says limited services and hours... visually I can see that. But for someone using JAWS, they wouldn't know that. They could actually just you know, have a link to wherever the hours would be posted cuz... people should know that palestine isn't going to be a 24 hour clinic. They should know that! It's just a small town.

TASK 2
------

[Nearest dermatologist?]

Sometimes houston is all encompassing so you don't need to do all these searches. It's just a 4 hour drive! So you know I don't drive, so it's not on me.

*in the footer, tabbing through footer* *returns to top* *starts tabbing all the way through*

See it doesn't tell you "hey we got your results" so sometimes I'm like has it updated yet?

[59:04]

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/MLS_PfLAhsxhiBs0PA3JZPrOWGU-8pz1ukOJi5TRZoc84rIoP9XLwwPKw8u0nKowFcZ07FhaXegJdE-gSXp43DWev5OyZCCMRl_D-TJmYdNJO-gvrLsfXib9R3QACZCSybxpgjlj)

It didn't tell me if my search loaded up. Oh so Palestine has a dermatologist... that's interesting.

[Try to imagine... that you're planning a trip and you'd like to know closest VA hospital]

So it loaded it... it didn't sound right but ok that's what it was. There was... voiceover was talking "internet connection isn't stable" came up [Josh: probably overrode the announcement]

It doesn't tell me that it loaded the results... that's always the challenge. I mean it takes a long time to load some pages. Verbally right away "your search results came in, Hibbing is your closest" some verbal prompt that tells me it did what I asked for it to do.

[Magic wand]

[Facility type]

You know. An interactive map is great and all. So... I don't know. Overall it's fine. It would be nice *sigh*... you know the facility type thing is a little confusing for me. It would be nice to have that broken down a little bit for options. The VA health thing... So... I mean I guess instead of saying "VA HEALTH"... all of those things underneath are va health pieces... so maybe "VA hospital, CBOC, VA urgent care clinic, or whatever..."

[travel and emergency use case]

 because sometimes most of the time we use a VA out of state you're looking to find an ER VA that's open 24 hours, one that does emergent issues, etc. You know. If you're traveling in advance, you get your meds done in advance. Unless there's a problem, you don't need to go to an actual clinic unless you're in the traveling Vet program.

[facility locator who uses this and why?]

Most people using this are first time VA people, so they're looking for their parent, friend, to find a close VA. If it's an emergent situation it's when people are on vacation like, I'm here, where's the nearest VA or do I need to go to a civilian place.

*PHONE CALL* The VA calls me everyday around 9 o clock. Yea their weight loss program, mildly annoying on Sunday mornings.

[grave sites? Cemeteries]

So unless you're moving to a new place... most people probably wouldn't even go to this piece. You know when I was scrolling earlier I did see that it had burial? *VA CEMETERIES* If I had known I could look it up here... it just didn't. I wouldn't have guessed. I wouldn't have guessed cemeteries would be on facilities. So... yea... I don't know. I guess. It can be convenient but I don't know.

[Other apps that do a good job for finding locations or in general?]

Um... you know. I guess it's... not...

*ALERT TRANSCRIPT ON*

It's more on how detailed my request is? And how they sort their results. Google is great at times, but you really need to listen to the link to know if it's an authentic website or reliable source.

[MAPS]

As far as maps... I usually don't do them... I did the around me app which used your location and it would tell you what was in a certain distance around you.

[BeMyEyes live person with video app]

And then I use "be my eyes"... sometimes putting on my connection if I'm looking for something in particular and I'm just struggling with. And then someone can say "hey it's on the bottom", it's a live person, who has a video who can see... so say you're at an airport, a live person can help you find a gate through your camera. If you're at a grocery store too.

[IRA APP]

There's a paid app too like IRA. Some parts are free... I think the VA has a contract with them for some people. Similar concept."

[What helps you know authentic?]

For a dot gov website I'll know it will be verified information otherwise... *sigh* it needs to be an organization I trust or know like a DAV, VFW, American Legion. If it's VET HEALTH blah blah blah, half the time they are looking for money. They're either trying to help you for your claim for a piece of it, or route you to their sponsors to get a piece of the action. I had three different websites try to sell me a burial plot and burial benefits. That's the hard part disseminating what's real information, and what's a sale pitch.

[Magic wand]

*ALERT LIVE TRANSCRIPT ON*

I guess.. I would look at... um... personally I'd like... the main links at the top of the page and then when I go to... I know y'all have a column that have a main link for the VA website and it's on every page pretty much. But when I click into a page... the top of the page should be the information for that page. So when I go to find locations... I mean like... you kinda know what you're getting into. Like, it should bring up the form first... rather than links to a bunch of other stuff to read would be nice. *home links*

Simplify make it easier. You knwo the Veterans I deal with blinded Vets, most of them get so frustrated that they just don't continue with their computer. I get lazy with JAWS because I don't use it everyday. To make it simpler, let's just delve right into the forms I need to move into the next step. If I want an additional explanation or the links at the top on every page, visually it does make sense, but for a screen reader that needs to read through all that crap you stop listening after the first 30 seconds and then you have to go all the way back if you missed something [*SET FOCUS TO H1 WHEN COMING FROM A LINK]

I appreciate it. That was rough I'm so sorry.

[No! It's fine! Def not the most difficult session. This was just fine we learned a ton today, can't thank you enough.]

Most of the people doing these surveys are like younger Vets... most of them are... I'm still like 43, I'm still one of the younger Vets that go through blind rehab because our average is 60 or older. It's usually age related issues, diabetes, or whatever. But... yea I recommend getting a connection with them [who?]. Right now they're at half staff because of COVID, but usually they have like 30 Vets in everyday.
