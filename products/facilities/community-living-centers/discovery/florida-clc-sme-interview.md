### Full transcript

- [Introductions, recording interview, and showing the current legacy site]
- [Nick] Who would you say this facility is most likely to serve in terms of demographics?

> Well, it's all on the page, the page you just went to. We have short-term and we do have a long-term stay - and we have hospices there.

- [Nick] How do people staying there refer to the facility?

  - [Explains that "Community Living Center" is common among people who stay  there]

- [Nick] Is there anything that anyone with physical limitations should know before coming into the program? [No] Is there a maximum physical disability you're able to accomodate?

> I don't know. We haven't had any challenges like that. I wouldn't go there [the website] and put any maximum challenges or anything like that, I would keep it generic. 
> Pretty much what's on the page now is what we want on the page. If you want to reformat [that's fine] - is there something different we need to add?

- [Nick] I think there's some specifics anbout the admissions process that we could do a better job describing. If someone wants to be admitted to the program, is there any specific person they should call or be able to talk to?

> Yes, we have the contact [shows number on page] - the Admissions Coordinator.

- [Michelle] Do Veterans typically self-refer? What does that process look like?

> No - most of our patients come from the inpatient unit [at the VAMC]. Pre-covid - it just depends on where we are with covid - we can go back to taking patients
> from the community, but they usually still have to go through the [unintelligible - VAMC unit?], covid has kind of changed things, but the vast majority of our
> patients come from the hospital.

- [Nick] How would you say most people find out about the community living center? [Explained that we've seen that word of mouth has been very important for other kinds of facilities]

> Probably from the in-patient social workers. [About word of mouth] That's true, pre-covid we did do a few outreach [events] - mostly hospital based outreach, not really way out in 
> the community anywhere. In the hospital, more geared towards making sure providers and other people who refer here were aware of everything that we offered, [for example]
> our short-term rehabilitation is a newer program for us, and not everyone had that much information about that part of the program, which is why we highlighted
> it on the page a little bit more. But yes there's a word of mouth component.

- [Nick] So someone would have to be referred by a third party, or is someone able to call and start the admissions process themselves?

> Not right now, our admissions for our short-stay rehab program is from the hospital.

- [Nick] Are there any specific elegibility requirements for this facility that might not be present for other community living centers?

> No. [Nick gives example of spinal cord injury] We have a large spinal cord injury unit at the hospital, so we really don't do that at the clc.

- [Michelle] Is a typical patient someone who has had [example procedures] and then needs a transition to get back home, is that the ususaly scenario?

> Not often, we have an acute rehab program here at this facility, so alot of [those kinds of things] go to those facilities at the hospital.

- [Nick] If you were updated the site, is there anything in particular you would want people to know before coming to the facility?

> Right now, we're not currently taking long-stay as an admission in our facility. That's why we mostly focused on our short-stay rehab program. We still actually
> have a long-term care program, and long-stay residency, but we're not actively admitting long-stay at this time.

- [Nick] Is there an average length of stay for the short-term stay?

> [Searches for info] Our average length of stay is usually pretty short, it's somehwere around two weeks, but I can get you a more exact...we try to keep it to three 
> months or less, but I think we're significantly less than that. Year-to-date for this year [2021], average length of stay is 18 days.

- [Michelle] Will you return to admissions for long-term, is that like a capacity thing?

> It's not a capacity thing no, that's an option we're looking at returning to but we're not there yet. We don't have anything definitive on that yet.

- [Nick] Have there every been any services that people have requested that are not offered at this location?

> Sometimes people want long-stay, but we're no actively admitting so, there's only under circumstances that we've taken on a long-stay patient. We're looking at other things we could potentially do that are like specific focus, like STIs. We have a robust STI program, and a rehab, and poly-rehab program here, so some of the things you would normally see clcs in other areas doing, it's not as much of an option for us because of the other services that are already being offered in other parts of the hospital.

- [Nick] Are there any services that someone would need to be at the clc for a certain amount of time before they qualify for them? [Explain dental care example]

> I don't know, truthfully, I'm not that in the weeds for stuff like that. I thought that was based on your service connection, as for dental and vision, I thought you had to be 100% service connected to qualify for those. 

- [Nick] Is there anything that might useful for someone coming into the facility to know, that isn't currently on the website?

> No, I think we are looking trying to make some changes to our programs, and as I said potentially offer some long-stay, but that's not approved yet. So I wouldn't change anything on this page - like we literally, I want to say it was a year ago maybe a year and half, we just updated this. Then we had covid, so we're not doing anything new. I think right now it kind of captures what we're doing.

- [Michelle] What about visitor policies?

> It's covid, so right now we're not doing any. Prior to that I think we kind of left this off [the site]. In our resident handbooks it has informatio about our regular visiting, which is usually fairly liberal pre-covid. Hospice is mostly anytime, and we still have compassionate care visits for hospice. On the other units it still was fairly liberal, you can visit mostly anytime. So, we didn't have "no visiting after a certain time", we just had to be careful that people weren't trying to like move in. Literally we had that happen one time, like you can't live here. Generally our visiting is fairly liberal, and it's in our resident handbook so we didn't put it on the website.
> They should have a handbook from the regular hospital, and part of our admissions process, since most of our admissions come from the hospital, our Admissions Coordinator goes and greets the patients there. So they get information about our program before they even get here, and then on admission they get a handbook. [Michelle: So we could have them refer to that]

- [Nick] Is that handbook available online somewhere? [No] Why not?

> It's not online, it's our own internal document. We don't want it put online - I don't have a good reason, we just never had it online, we haven't discussed it. I would have to bring that to committee and see if that's something we'd be able to do.

- [Nick] Are pets or service animals allowed at the clc?

> No, for most service animals you have to be able to take care of that animal, including [walking, picking up after it, etc.], and a majority of our residents can't. I think we've occasionally had a service animal once in a blue moon, but I don't want to put anything about pets on the website. It's a potentially contentious issue. We've had pets come in over hospice situations, but it starts getting into a weird situation because most of the people here cannot truly take care of pets or service animals on their own. So technically if they can't take care of it, it shouldn't be here.

- [Michelle] Does it make sense for clc facilities to have their own site, or just be combined with the hospital page?
- [We demonstrate indiviual clc pages, and VAMC with extended care info sections. We demonstrate Miles City clc VA site page]

> If you look at that, that's pretty much what we did on our page [legacy page]. To me this just has a lot of extraneous - like a map and other things, they have way to many clinical hours for what a clc is, and then, it's not a visit [referring to "Prepare for your visit" section] we're not a clinic. Parking and transportation I guess we could do that...and this "In the spotlight" looks like it would be generic for the hospital. Then when you scroll down [we look at "Extended care" accordion], that pretty much is what we offer.

- [We show a VAMC site page with an "Extended care" accordion section]

> Yeah, that's great, I think that's about what we need. Unless somebody specifically wanted to contact us. If you click on the "learn more about VA long-term care" does that take you to another page? [We explain general VA long-term care info page]

- [Michelle] What were you expecting it to show you?

> Like something more similar to what we already have [something more specific to the VAMC clc]. This is fine, but we do have the general contact, I don't think too many people call directly to the [clc] admissions person. I don't think we get frequent callers saying they want to come to the clc - we do get some, don't get me wrong because I get the calls myself, but [the general VA long-term info page] there's no contact number...this is very brief. I just feel like the current page is setup for a hospital not a nursing home. 
> If you called ours [VAMC main number] you're not getting that number that we put on the site [legacy clc page]. They're just going to pick a random number, or one of the unit numbers or something like that.

- [Nick] So someone calling would just get transferred to somebody who *might* be relevant?

> Yes, like if you called [the VAMC main number] and said "hey I want to get admitted to the clc" I don't know who the operator's going to give you. I get some of these calls, random calls asking to be admitted to the hospital, I honestly can't say if someone called here [VAMC] that they're going to get to the right person. So that might be a good thing to fix. This number right here [on legacy site page] transfers you to the Admissions Coordinator. That's their extension, so the call would go specifically to that person.
> Then we put the business hours, not necessarily the hours the clc is open for visitation, but the business hours, if you're looking for an Admissions Coordinator or the business office, for example. 

- [Michelle] That would be helpful, to have those labeled accordingly so people know who they're calling, and that those hours represent that person's availability.

> We even put a little bit about admissions, because most people are coming to the clc to be admitted to the clc, and then our goal is for people to be discharged from the clc, we really don't admit long-stay, so we put a little bit about that. 

[Nick] If you would like to see any of our eventual designs we can let you know when those are ready.

> Yes, like before they go live.

[Michelle] Yeah, that would be great to get some feedback and see whether you think it works.

> [Looking at Miles City clc example VA page map] I don't know if you have an actual campus map, because they thing is, we're part of the - we're there on campus. So, it's really not helping anyone if you just show them [the generic google map]. Something like a more detailed map vs just where the VAMC is located [We look at campus map]. So we're right here - here's the main hospital and we're literally across the driveway. It might change a little when they open up [new building on campus], I'll have to see how they handle the entry [to new building]. I think that would be helpful to someone that was coming here.

[Michelle] What about parking, is there shared parking? Is there recommended parking for visitors to your facility?

> Prior to covid, we had shuttles that would take you directly between the main hospital and building 30 [the clc building.] So people who came to see our residences during regular business hours, till 7-8 whenever the shuttle stopped running, they could park in the parking garage and take the shuttle. It would drop them off pretty much in front of the building to where it's a very short walk. [She discusses current entry into the clc, via hospital]

[Michelle] Right that's a good point, because the "Prepare for your visit" section is also "prepare to visit someone" - preferrend entrance is important.
