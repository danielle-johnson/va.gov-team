## Description

Veterans got very confused when looking at the Contact Email Address section of personal and contact information during our June 2021 notification settings study ([read finding](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/notifications/notification-preferences/discovery-and-research/notifications-research-findings.md#5-of-9-participants-experienced-concerns-and-confusion-about-their-sign-in-vs-contact-email-address)). With this improvement, we'll update that section of profile to better clarify the distinction between the two email addresses.

This change impacts the personal and contact information section of profile.
