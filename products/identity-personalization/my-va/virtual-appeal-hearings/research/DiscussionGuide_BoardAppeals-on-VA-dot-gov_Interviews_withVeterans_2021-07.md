# **Discussion Guide: Understanding Board Appeal Hearings on VA.gov**



## **Intro (5 minutes)**

Hi [participant name], thank you for joining us today! I hope your day is going well. Is now still a good time to talk?

Great! I'm [researcher name] working on behalf of the Board of Veterans' Appeals. I have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. We're interested in learning what the hearing process is like for Veterans like yourself, how you select the hearings type that is right for you so we can help make scheduling and attending your hearing much easier. The format of this session is: we will begin with some questions that would help me get some background information about your hearings, then talk about a new type of virtual hearing to see what you think, and then if you could log into your VA account & show us how you'd find hearing info there [if they don’t have an account, the moderator will share screen & prototype] and some follow up questions

Before we start, I want to go over a few things:

1. In total, this session won't last more than an hour, but if we end earlier that's completely fine too; we just wanted to reserve enough time so that we don't feel rushed.
2. This may go without saying, but I want to note that your participation is voluntary and you don’t have to answer any questions you don’t want to or don't feel comfortable with. Also, we can end the interview at any time you want to without affecting your compensation.
3. We are looking for an honest opinion. There are no right or wrong answers. We are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

I wanted to get your consent on two things:

**Taking notes** – [note-taker's name] will be taking detailed notes which will only be shared within our project team. Identifying information will not be written down in the notes so we hope you feel you can speak openly.

**Recording** – If it’s alright with you, we’d like to audio record this session to refer back to the conversation when checking our notes, and will destroy these right after we're done.

Are you alright with us taking notes and recording? Also, do you have any questions for me before we begin?
