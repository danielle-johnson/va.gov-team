# **Research Plan: Understanding Board Appeal Hearings on VA.gov**

Date: July-August 2021

## **Goals**

### **Product and Team**

This research plan outlines the Caseflow Team's approach to understanding where in the VA.gov authenticated experience Veterans expect to find and make changes to information about their Board of Veterans' Appeals hearing. This exploratory research will inform the next stages of design for choosing a virtual hearing on VA.gov.

### **Background**

In March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board of Veterans' Appeals expanded access to virtual hearings to all Veterans. Virtual hearings allow Veterans, their representatives, and Board Veterans Law Judges to attend a hearing via video conference using their own device and from the location of their choice, eliminating the need to travel to a VA Regional Office.

However, there is not a self-service way for Veterans with an existing appeal to notify the Board that they would like to change to a virtual hearing. Hearing Coordinators at the Board are currently calling and emailing Veterans and their representatives to ask if they would like to change to virtual and then manually recording responses in Caseflow. This method is not only inefficient, but it also requires a lot of one-on-one communication by Hearing Coordinators to confirm that Veterans have the technical requirements in place to participate in a virtual hearing. In FY22, the Board needs to scale up to contacting more than 60,000 Veterans who are waiting for a hearing. Having a way for Veterans to opt-in to a virtual hearing on VA.gov will allow the Board to focus on scheduling and holding virtual hearings instead of finding out if a Veteran would like a virtual hearing.

### **Research Questions**

- Where in the  VA.gov authenticated experience do Veterans expect to be able to change their existing hearing request type to virtual?
- What information do Veterans need to confidently make a decision about whether they'd like a virtual hearing?
- How do Veterans find and manage information about their Board hearing now?

### **Hypotheses**

- Veterans will expect to see and make changes to their existing hearing request within the Track Claims section of the  VA.gov authenticated experience.
- Veterans may have concerns about virtual hearing technology requirements that would impact their willingness to choose the virtual hearing format.
- Veterans will want to receive clear guidance on next steps.



## **Method**

**What method of research are you planning?**

Remote, semi-structured interviews and usability testing of the existing VA.gov authenticated experience

**Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?**

Semi-structured interviews help the Caseflow Team to uncover rich descriptive data on the personal experiences of Veterans as they decide whether or not to choose a virtual hearing. The flexible format allows for a more open-ended discussion, which can surface pain points and areas for improvement that the Caseflow Team might not otherwise think to ask about. The interviews will be conducted remotely to allow us to speak with people located throughout the United States.

Having participants complete tasks using the current VA.gov authenticated experience will help us understand how they find information about their Board hearing and gain insight into the type(s) of information they may expect to see.

**Where are you planning to do your research?**

Remotely via Zoom

**What will you be testing?**

- Participants who have accounts will log in to [VA.gov](http://VA.gov)
- Participants who don't have accounts will be shown a clickable prototype created from VA.gov staging screenshots



## **Participants and Recruitment**

### **Recruitment Strategy**

The Caseflow Team will work with Perigean to recruit participants with a **Board appeal hearing**.

> When a Veteran disagrees with a VA decision on a claim for benefits, they can choose from 3 decision review options (Supplemental Claim, Higher-Level Review, or **Board Appeal**). If a Veteran chooses a Board Appeal, they have another 3 options (Request a Direct Review, Submit more evidence, **Request a hearing**). We'd like to speak with participants who have **chosen a Board appeal and requested a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge**. 



### **Participant Criteria**

**We'd like to interview 6 Veterans.**

In order to speak with 6 Veterans, we'd like Perigean to recruit 10, with the expectation that there be a max of 3-4 no shows. We'll ask to cancel any remaining sessions once we hit 6.



#### **Must have (absolutely must be true in order to run the study)**

- Participants must be able to participate via a laptop or desktop. Phones/iPads will not work.

- Participants must be able to screen share via Zoom.

- Have you requested or participated in a hearing with a Judge from the Board of Veterans’ Appeals to review a VA claims decision? (For more information about Board appeals hearings, see https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/board-appeal/veterans-law-judge-hearing/)

  - [radio buttons]: Yes, No
  - Answer must be Yes

  

#### **Good to have (other criteria that would strengthen results)**

> *Plain language summary — We'd like a mix of:*
>
> - *Participants who are able to login to the [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) authenticated experience to view their claim/appeal status (i.e. LOA3 level of assurance) and those who cannot / don't have an account*
> - *Participants who have completed their hearing and those who are still waiting*
> - *Participants who've had a virtual tele-hearing and those who had their hearing at a VA facility*
> - *Demographic and geographic diversity*
