# Action items plan and questions
June 30, 2021

## Schedule/things to do

*Set up something in Notion!

- Get feedback on concepts- refine, refine, refine.
- Reach out to accessibility early to help us understand what is possible accessibility-wise when it comes to action items/notifications.
- Land on refined-ish concepts to test with - using the current My VA and understanding that designs will change in the future.
- Do research on concepts to establish direction
- Synthesize and make recommendations on how to move forward

## Things to figure out

- What 'action items' do we currently give Veterans?
  - For MVP we will be starting with any notifications from VA notify. Right now those are:
    - Reminders to finish in-progress applications
    - Board of appeals hearing reminders
    - Scheduled payment updates
    - Appointment reminders
    - Prescription shipment and tracking updates
    - Covid-19 updates

  We would like to add 'new messages' to this, but we will need to talk with the VA notify team to get this implemented.
- What 'action items' are actually useful to Veterans?
- How are we handling 'action items' elsewhere on the site? (if anywhere) Is the current approach on VA.gov working (if any)?
  -  Based on an [audit of VA.gov](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/action-items-discovery/va.gov-action%20item-audit.md), there isn't really anywhere else that we are handling action items.
- What specific things in each section are important for users?
- What does an interaction look like around alert indicators?
- How does the alert indicator work? When does it go away? When does it show up?
- When is something considered read? What happens then?
- What types of information do we need to include in an action item alert?
- How do we make indicators accessible? What are some good examples of this?
- What icons clearly represent action items? (maybe bells and flags?)
- Are action items something that logged-in users **always** have access to? Or is it better for them to live on My VA?
- Should messages all be in one alert? Or should there be a separate alert for each message?
- How long can an action item be content-wise?
- How do we handle A LOT of unread alerts?
- What are the rules around different styles of alerts?
- How can we handle CTA's inside action items?
- Can users mark an alert as "read" to make the badge disappear, but still see the alert?
- Can users make an alert go away completely?
- Can users mark an alert as completed (and is that different from marking it as "read"?
- How long should alerts be available for?
- How does VA.notify know if things (text/email) have been read? Do they?
- Is a newsfeed approach the right approach?



## Things to test
- What are the action items that people expect to see?
- What action items can we show people?
- What are the most important action items for users?
- What are the least important action items for users?
- How do people expect to see these action items?
- How do people expect their action items to be ordered?
- Do people expect to see action items in sections or in an 'action item hub'?
- How do users expect to be able to resolve these action items?
- Will people come to My VA to see their notifications?
- Is duplication helpful? (indicator + actual notification)
- How do users think of alerts? (eg a to-do list or more of a notification?)
- Do people need to search/sort by for action items?
- What information about an action item do people need to see?
- Does showing the number of new alerts provide enough context to help veterans decide whether or not they want to see the alerts?
- Do users even want to see the number of new alerts, or is just knowing they have new alerts enough?
- Do we need to include new/viewed badges on notifications? If a user has recieved a text about an alert, and opens it and then goes to alerts in VA.gov and it isn't shown as 'viewed', is that okay?
- Do users need to see all the alerts they've ever had? 
- What should this section be called?? (alerts, notifications, action items??)
- Do people prefer newsfeed or actual alerts?
- How do people know if a task is complete?


## Questions for the team:
- What does scheduled payment updates mean?
- How does VA.notify know if things (text/email) have been read? Do they?
- Is there anything in the design system that you know of that show prioritization? Or urgency? (alerts have specific icons)
