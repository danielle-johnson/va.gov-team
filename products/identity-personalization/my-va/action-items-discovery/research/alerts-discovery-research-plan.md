# Research Plan for VSA Authenticated Experience: Action Items Discovery July/August 2021

## Goals

Our team is looking to give Veterans access to their recent action items in a centralized place. 
The goal of this research is to understand the best way to implement this new feature on VA.gov.
 
- How do users expect to find their action items? 

## Background



In many past user interviews, users have expressed the importance of having relevant or time-sensitive action items elevated.  Based on recent studies,  Having a centralized place for recent action items would be a large improvement and would help users complete important tasks efficiently.  

Our goal is to create a My VA dashboard design that will improve the online experience for Veterans, by better integrating Veteran-provided data onto the My VA dashboard. The MyVA dashboard aims to surface the status and the most recent update to a users health care information, claims information, and any applications in progress. Users should also be able to quickly and easily reach the tools that allow them to manage this information.

## Research questions

**Overall questions**
What are the action items that people expect to see?
What action items can we show people?
What are the most important action items for users?
What are the least important action items for users?
How do people expect to see these action items?
How do people expect their action items to be ordered?
Do people expect to see action items in sections or in an 'action item hub'?
How do users expect to be able to resolve these action items?
Will people come to My VA to see their notifications?
Is duplication helpful? (indicator + actual notification)
How do users think of alerts? (eg a to-do list or more of a notification?)
Do people need to search/sort by for action items?
What information about an action item do people need to see?
Does showing the number of new alerts provide enough context to help veterans decide whether or not they want to see the alerts?
Do users even want to see the number of new alerts, or is just knowing they have new alerts enough?
Do we need to include new/viewed badges on notifications? If a user has recieved a text about an alert, and opens it and then goes to alerts in VA.gov and it isn't shown as 'viewed', is that okay?
Do users need to see all the alerts they've ever had?
What should this section be called?? (alerts, notifications, action items??)
Do people prefer newsfeed or actual alerts?
How do people know if a task is complete?
## Hypothesis & assumptions

- The new myVA dashboard layout will overall be intuitive and scan-able
- Users will understand how to navigate to tools to manage their information
- Users may want to see some additional information on the dashboard that we did not include
- Participants might be confused about some of the verbiage used (most likely in the prescriptions section)
- Participants might be confused that the links to view all (i.e. You have 2 unread messages) will take them to a separate page/site

## Method
We will conduct remote moderated usability testing via Zoom using the Perigean contract. This method will allow us to share a high-fidelity wireframe prototype.

## Participants and Recruitment

Recruit for 12 sessions (8 fulfilled sessions) using the following criteria:

### Must have for participants

* Are you eligible for/recieve VA health care, have active or past claims or recieve any benefits from the VA? (pass = yes)
    * If participants with health care, claims or benefits are too difficult to recruit for, then expand to having logged-in to va.gov within the last year.

### Good to have for participants
* At least one iOS mobile device owner
* At least one Android mobile device owner
* At least 2 women
* At least 1 person of color
* At least 2 participants 35 or under and 1 participant over 55
* At least 1 participant who currently receives VA health care
* At least one person with a disability rating of 70% or greater
* At least one person with an identified cognitive consideration of PTSD or TBI
 

### Recruitment requirements
* All participants must use a mobile device.
* The participants have Zoom downloaded **on their phone** prior to the session
* The participants know how to screen-share.

We will not be able to accommodate non-sighted users due to the prototype technology.
