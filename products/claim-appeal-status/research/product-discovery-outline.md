# Claim Status Tool V2 - Product Discovery Outline

### Where we are currently
In our pre-discovery of the claim status tool, we have conducted co-design sessions, have done a competitive analysis, have reviewed call center statistics, and have reviewed findings from past usability sessions.

We’ve generated a list of action items our team members will take in order to get the best understanding of what’s possible and what opportunities we can pursue with a full redesign of the claim status tool.

### Action items

#### Do some technical discovery with the current tool
-	What is the exhaustive list of all possible claims for the CST?
-	What is the exhaustive list of all possible appeals for the CST?
-	Where does the claim status come from?
-	What are all the (existing) possible claim statuses?
-	Where does the ‘steps’ data come from?
-	What are all the (existing) possible steps?
-	What services are called to populate a user’s claim list?
-	What endpoints exist today? Do we need to make new endpoints?

#### Do some business process discovery with the current tool
-	Who/what team handles the status changes?
-	What is the current business process for handling claims?
-	What software is utilized by staff to update claim statuses?
-	Are there any automatic (non-human) processes that affect statuses or steps?
#### Further quantitative and qualitative analysis of the current tool
-	Look at all use cases that exist within the CST
-	Burial and Memorials
-	Pension claims
-	Compensation
-	Education?
-	Housing? 
-	What are the touchpoints the VA has with the user during this process?
-	Letter in the mail?
-	Emails? 
-	Phone calls? (CP exam)
-	Ask a question (IRIS)
-	Pain points that have been expressed
-	What detailed call center data can we access to understand usability issues in the current tool?
-	What usability issues have been identified as a part of past usability testing?
-	What types of metrics can we pull?
-	Can we determine how many claims an average user has at a given time?
-	Can we determine what types of claims are most prevalent?
-	Can we determine wait times between the existing steps?
#### Understanding of the political climate of the claim status tool
-	Who are our stakeholders?
-	Should we ensure that there is at least one representative from each area we identify (if there are multiple teams/disciplines)?
-	What could cause friction in the process?
-	What do we already know about needs/wants from different stakeholders?
-	Set up meetings with all relevant stakeholders.
-	Conduct stakeholder interviews (set of questions)
