## Questions we're trying to answer: 

- What kind of governance activities currently exist for the legacy VA.gov? 
- What's working, what's not? 
- Who or what teams are responsible for what? 
- What models of governance do other organizations - private or government - use? 
- What governance model and activities should we implement/practice to ensure quality web customer experience on the modernized VA.gov?
